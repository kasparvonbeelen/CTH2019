Take her pet cause on family leave: what Oliver didn&#39;t and should have mentioned is that Ivanka&#39;s own company, where she has the power to implement any policy of her choosing, offers no family leave plan of any kind for anyone. The most logical takeaway from that is that it&#39;s a cause to take up just to create the appearance of caring about some kind of positive issue to counteract the punitive nature of Trump&#39;s message, but doesn&#39;t actually mean a word of it. There is no evidence to support the assumption that Ivanka Trump is a moral person with any motivations not rooted in personal ambition.

Ugy2i7WH1FEnWSV6hcx4AaABAg	0	1	2018-11-26 05:08:39	Salina Singh	Trump ran for office, because his daughter, who he claims to be strategically smart (i.e. smarter than the majority that he dupes with word tricks), wants to be the 1st female President! This is obvious since she filled in for him as a delegate at the G20 Summit for only World Leaders. Suddenly, she can claim to have more experience than any challenger. Also, she fixes his hard to make faux pas which he won&#39;t make when trying to keep his shows on air. Moreover, he was not being lewd about Ivanka ever let alone lying about never changing diapers. Rather, this was also strategic because the media treats them like targets.

And it will take years to undo the distrust other countries will have for America. After Trump has broken our trade agreements, and partnerships on many different fronts, we&#39;ll have real trouble regaining the trust of the rest of the world. And even WORSE then that, is the sad fact that people will look back at this shit show as the way politics is ran in America. Because if u think we&#39;re going back thru the looking glass, you&#39;re wrong. Politicians will run these same divisive &amp; fact challenged tactics as the norm from now on.

Possession of less than a gram of any hard narcotic is 2 yr for me, 6 months probation and a wipe of the record for a standard rich kid, dropped and no charges pressed for a real connected rich kid with parents in politics. <br />BUT it ate my 17 paragraph walk though common sense. <br />Just remember that that last application for a prep-cook position i saw wanted 5 yr experience, a background check, and a urine-analysis. For 2.13 an hour part time to avoid having to offer you overpriced employee buy-in of medical insurance. <br />This world is falling apart and were all complacent.<br />Luckily i am a tattoo artist and no matter how shitty the economy gets people will want to forever imprint their loves/ideals/fandoms/memories in their skin, so i wont want for work...<br />Even though i am a 7-9 times felon (depending if you count probation violations while on probation as new felonies as the state does)<br />But ive gotten past that, found my niche giving boring housewives and drunken junior enlisted the thattoos that wanted since they were 15. Dont knock it till youve worked it. Its still customer service, we still have to smile and pretend your order is &quot;a great idea and will tolltally make you look cool&quot; at least i was avle to claw my way up, do the 1000+ hrs of practicaps i needed to get licensed by the state, overcomw a huge prejudice from the licensing committee, that wanted letters from probation officers i had that werent even alive anymore, letters proving from the parole board that I &quot;had their blessing&quot; evem though none of the people i contacted had ever met me or read my file (destroyed after 6 months of completion of probation)<br />I know i sound like im bitchinf but im not. Im actually happy i was avle to jump through the hoops, because otherwise the only job available to mw would be that 2.13$ waitressing job. <br />I much prefrr making 50/100 an hr. <br />It my not be as much as these suck children of childrenof handed down wealth get.. But.<br />Its a cash only business in 70% of thw county, and the last bastion of self-work and self-come-uppancethat many of us artistic felons have.<br />TRUMP is a punk, but im really not comfortable wirh pence.<br /><br />IF YOURE A FELON YOU CAN REGISTER TO VOTE IN MANY STATE ONCE YOUVE COMPLETED PROBATION!! <br />PE<br />LEASE GO VOTE. OUR OPINIONS ANS VOICES WILL BE HEARD.<br />(Also you can travel outside of the country, just follow whatever steps your local passport office tells you ) (violent criminals and sex offenders are usually denied so dont be those people.)

Trump lacks emotional intelligence to prevent him to say seemingly lewd things but, as a sociopathic businessman, he's used to saying things that gain an applause or reaction. The only way I can explain his thought is that he's comfortable with his daughter, and he's trying to make people laugh. Ofcourse we all know how it played out, but that's because we look at it in our perspective instead of a sociopathic businessman who lived a life of manipulating people.

(As far as &quot;good-looking&quot; is concerned, here in Europe - im not talking about the UK - Ivanka counts as fugly. )	UCBnoQTc_f4_-r6LT-c9AVzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBnoQTc_f4_-r6LT-c9AVzg	0

That is just how fucking stupid and worthless Americans are. Most Americans equate rich and or pretty as trustworthy. Most Americans equate poor and or ugly as "serial killer." I am an old man laughing my ass off at the destruction of America. The nazipublican khristian fucktards think Jeeeeezus will swoop down and sweep them up to heaven when they bring all hell and damnation upon this HEAVENLY PLANET. I am an American Indian and I say fuck you evil white fucks. Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini was right: America is the great white Satan.

Don't get me wrong: I completely support all of Bernie's ideas. The difference between me and those "progressives" of preschool intellect is that I know the difference between "utopian fantasy" and cold hard reality. Mark my word, those fucktard progressives will stay home in November. They have divided the DEMOCRATIC party into a toothless helpless old dog. The "progressives" are the "tea party" of the DEMOCRATS. But where as the "tea party radicals" of the nazipublican are embraced by the remainder of the moderate right, the ignorant progressive children of the DEMOCRATIC PARTY have ripped us asunder.

On the dozens of times it has been on the media clips on YT and 4-5 times Oliver has mentioned??? His Dad donated 2 million for "Renovations" to the Uni. But of course it was a straight out bribe... So now, research it and next time research it first so you can learn ...I'm not trying to be a smart arse towards you, but people need to be able to learn not to just ask other people on the internet, because you will get a 100 different (all wrong) answers...

Listen to her quote given here. She&#39;s a clear sociopath, and you should not trust a thing you hear from her, and you should not minimize nearly anything your gut tells you with individuals like this. You can not, use pure rationale and empathy with these individuals, because sociopaths know the game. I believe the Trumps have made that more than apparent.

No idendity per se. But that is a real possibility considering the Trump&#39;s family dynamics. An overbearing and narcissist father that allows no space for building up a true core of self for his children. As far as I am aware, they all work for him, have not built an independent life, even though the financial means were there for them to do so. Correct me if I am wrong. But it seems they built their career under the Trump umbrella. Ivanka got her fashion business somehow, on her own? Or under the Trump&#39;s brand? As an incentive. Difficult to say. Still, even if am disgusted by this exploitation of one&#39;s own children and their seemlingly acceptance of this exploitation because it enables them to afford a lavish lifestyle, I somehow feel sorry for them.

Her intelligence is up to par with that of a High School student that skipped every grade from 4&#39;th. She doesn&#39;t understand the meanings of the words she uses and to be fair... She&#39;s not all that hot either.<br /><br />I suppose that if your type is a long haired twelve year old boy then yeah, she&#39;s very attractive because that is exactly what she looks like.<br /><br />I could literally go out tonight and find at least 100 women more attractive than her that actually have the shapes of a woman too. Of course, it&#39;s hardly fair since I&#39;m Swedish.<br /><br />Jared is doing business and getting supported by the nations the US supports, the more support, the more his family rakes in. He met with Russians, Israelis and has pledged his allegiance to SA, Israel and Russia but NOT the US.<br /><br />Doesn&#39;t matter, Trumptards still love him because he has a cute penis and male Trumptards love a cute penis. (yes, I&#39;m calling them gay because that is what they are, whether you find Ivanka or Jared hot doesn&#39;t actually matter, they have exactly the same body type, male, 12 years old).

Evangelicals playing pretend that they care about anyone but themselves.<br /><br />It&#39;s fucking hilarious because they speak the words and spit on the less fortunate at every turn.<br /><br />No wonder they had to leave England (and unlike what Americans have been taught, they did not leave England because of persecution, they had to leave to be able to murder those that didn&#39;t follow their faith. Go look up Mary Dyer, murdered because she switched to quaker and it was all lawful, everyone was supposed to follow the one true faith or else. The story is longer than that but they were not accepted anywhere from the Netherlands to England and so they had to find new ground to institute their murderous hellhole and that ... that is America. Still not up to anything better from the looks of it.)<br /><br />Maybe that is why Evangelicals suppor the Wahabbis and now want to give them nuclear technology? Same shit, different religion.

However, It&#39;s clear he is not even a good with delegating if he is appointing so much responsibility onto one man. Its not possible it any way for Jared to accomplish all that he is tasked with. He has also shown to appoint people into heads of these important department that are not qualified in the slightest or are the complete conflict of interest for those departments.

They are all Alumnus of the Cambridge University FABIAN SOCIETY. YES, JOHN OLIVER IS A FABIAN. IF YOU LIKE STALIN&#39;S PURGE? YOU WILL LOVE JOHN OLIVER. Oh, and all of their Scholarship[s were paid with by NAZI Gold, Minted Post-1955 by Juan Peron of Argentina, and then laundered through the Vatican. Fra. Matthew Festing Butt-Plugged Oliver.

Can you seriously picture Jesus being a Trump sycophant? Can you say with a straight face you think Jesus the Almighty Christ of God would wear a MAGA trucker cap?

Alexander Hamilton famously never shut the fuck up and was quite boisterous. Also Alexander Hamilton was the Treasury secretary and not in any capacity involved in international policy, unless you count his fighting in the Revolutionary War. In which case he was pro-revolution and I have a distinct feeling that Alexander Hamilton would be disgusted and embarrassed to be even slightly compared to one of the Trump Administration.

Much like Ivanka speeches, they sound good and can apply to anyone. Just enough information to seem like it’s giving you something, but in reality she’s saying nothing of substance. Designed to not hurt anyone’s feeling keeping it pc for all you sheeple out there, while saying absolutely nothing.

It was assumed that she must because she is a woman and he’s a sexist, and she ran with it. There’s no reason to believe that she and he “certainly” disagree on planned parenthood, we just assumed so because she is a woman.

He doesn't exactly make an effort to hide that facet of his personality. In any case, there are a lot of people on Quora who have answered this question (link: https://www.quora.com/Is-Trump-a-misogynist-Why-do-people-call-him-a-misogynist) quite satisfactorily. You will find screenshots of Trump's exact words as they were typed, and several other citations and sources to refer to. But then again, like Trent has already pointed out, if you've failed to notice all of this already, you're probably beyond help.

Hamilton couldn&#39;t keep his mouth shut. In fact Hamilton wrote more than he listened. Alex stood up for and spoke out about what he believed in. If anything Jared could be Aaron Burr, not Hamilton. All in all I&#39;m just saying I want Scaramucci to know his founding fathers.

During his rallies he rarely looks down, meaning he probably doesn&#39;t even attempt to look at whats written. So Kushner could have very well had a hand in making his campaign topics, whether Trump even bothered to follow them is another thing.

A giant conspiracy theory to indoctrinate everyone into accepting leftism is a pretty extreme claim to make while citing no evidence. Do you not think maybe the reason STEM students are asked to take minors in Humanities subjects is to make them a more rounded individual with a wide skill set rather than to brainwash them to accept left wing propoganda like you've said - just seems more likely to me. And really? Cultural Marxism? That's a baseless conspiracy theory literally started by the fucking Nazis (Google cultural Bolshevism) that says everyone in the social sciences is a secret communist. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, I'm not just going to take your word for it that all of education is a conspiracy made by the Communists.

That is why mathematics, software engineering and computer science majors like myself are forced to take courses like cultural studies where all they do is bash science because it was invented by the "Imperialists".

I&#39;d say that at least 6 or 7 minutes of fluff could be taken out of this, but honestly the same actual relevant points could have been made with just the passage from Ivanka&#39;s book and talking about Jared relating to Harvard and that neighbour of his. I get wanting to make this the main story, but this honestly should have been one of your 8-10 minute main stories that you used to do. <br />While I&#39;m here, can I request that you go back to talking about issues like prison reform, infrastructure, and nuclear weapons? Every commentator and their dog talks about Trumpcare and the Russian connections, but this team is really the only one that tackles serious but lesser-known issues in society. There are a lot of smaller but no less important mountains we can reach out to Republicans to help us move, things that need to be fixed and have a better chance of actually changing. I&#39;m not saying we should abandon the big stories, but the current Democratic strategy is just preventing Republican-led change, not also pursuing Democrat or bipartisan change. Depending on who gets elected in 2020, we could be looking at between 12 and 16 years of gridlock with no important, permanent improvements being made. The world is passing us by.

The price is half a million dollars&#39; investment into one of the Trump&#39;s new real estate development.<br />So they&#39;re essentially selling resources of the United States for their family business&#39;s good.

Reminds me of Thatcher when she used to do her &quot;soft&quot; voice. Her head would tilt to one side and her pitch &amp; volume would be low &amp; steady. She also sounded totally condescending too. I think Ivanka VERY dangerous because people trust her more. I&#39;ve no reason to believe she is in ANY way better than her father. As for her husband, he seems thick as two short planks to me. And just as dodgy as the Trump clan.	UC-SL362i5SAGyoSG8R8NNFQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-SL362i5SAGyoSG8R8NNFQ	0

I wonder if she&#39;s proud of her father and all the disgusting ignorance he spews. If he were my dad, I&#39;d run and hide.

There&#39;s plenty of presidents, politicians and even recent candidates who we do know a lot about(or remember we know a lot about on the occasion it works in with our world view) and who would give us enough material to compose tomes upon tomes outlining the horrifying corruption that possible in humanity. The last few decades of American presidents have easily been responsible for more deaths than the Nazis, and Last Week Tonight is still really struggling with the idea that Trump became president? Really? Your last president built fleets of invisible flying robot assassins that can and do kill civilians in countries America isn&#39;t even at war with (a point Last Week Tonight did commendably make some time ago, and without the same level of incredulous hysteria). What could Trump do that was any worse? Authorize the spending of a trillion dollars of tax payers money to upgrade America&#39;s nuclear arsenal, in blatant disregard of the non-proliferation treaty? Nope, Obama bet him to that too. Condemn uncountable thousands to death with ridiculous sanctions placed on entire nations for mere suspicion of weapons of mass destruction? Has kind of been done to death by now, and besides, what would be the point of winning the election to do exactly what Clinton would&#39;ve done anyway. Calm down now. Trump seems like an idiot and still won the election because apparently that&#39;s what appeals to Americans. Maybe with a prominent place in the media you could stop for a little self-reflection at this point and look at what you&#39;ve contributed to the electoral process. Maybe the state of democracy deserves to have a mockery made of it, and this was indeed a complete circus, but everyone chose to go along with it, to shriek and make silly memes and post witty things on social media, and then to put all this crap on every tv station every hour for what? A year? Someone put the tv on at work at the start of the year and Trump wasn&#39;t even elected and it was a story about something he wrote on Twitter, with a scrolling bar at the bottom with Twitter updates from users. Maybe it&#39;s been a few years since I really watched tv, but still, wtf? And this video 9.6 million just on youtube in 2 months. Raise the bar a little higher maybe and lower the level of completely out of proportion hysteria.	UC4DhkjV6R-WHn_mnXnEqAAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DhkjV6R-WHn_mnXnEqAAg	0

When would she go there? Why? How??? She has butlers and servants for that and if she didn&#39;t, she&#39;d be on film doing these sorts of basic chores that we all consider routine. Here&#39;s another question: &quot;Ivanka, what was your first job? Also, by first job, I do not mean things your dad gave you money for.&quot; Follow up question &quot;Wow you said McDonald&#39;s? Weird, why did you do that, no seriously I mean what have you ever had to save up any money for, oh right nothing, so you haven&#39;t actually had regular employment of any sort by anyone ever so you have no clue how the world works or what it means to face real consequences, can you please go away and shut up and give back all your sweatshop dollars to China you greedy spider?&quot;	UCW36AXbxrtZgY3Zsphal_vg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW36AXbxrtZgY3Zsphal_vg	0

Jared and his surreal portfolio seems to be a way of keeping real Whitehouse staffers away from the real mechanisms at play. It may be that he is one of the key compromised players. In fact Kushner and his situation sounds more similar to Trump than anyone else. Both may be heavily leveraged by huge amounts of Russian money and offers they couldn&#39;t refuse.

If they formulate it like &quot;what do you disagree with your father on&quot;, how can they expect a clear answer. Or are there like some rules preventing them to ask a direct questions in America?

Later when he inherited his father&#39;s business, he made a bad deal and got himself into a billion dollar debt. Since then, he has been playing hardball with his lenders, using his newpaper organization, the observer, to lash out at these individuals. <br /><br />Dude has a talent for making enemies, and now he has made enemies with the intel community. He must be taken down but Trump might just pardon him.	UCrWzVWHJ03qIoPn8d9rTdVg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWzVWHJ03qIoPn8d9rTdVg	0

Trump was DUMB enough to make a deal with Putin to endorse improved relations and eventually lift sanctions in exchange for Russian meddling that would tip the election away from Hillary. Trump didn&#39;t realize Putin could then blackmail him at any time with ending his presidency (by revealing the collusion, invoking immediate impeachment). <br />This all ends in Trump and family getting booted out, with the entire world laughing at the sheer incompetence and vulnerability of the American government. The US will lose power and relevance and credibility. The damage done will be deep and lasting, as the American public pays for even worse economic disparity fanned on by Trump&#39;s disastrous policies (the top 1% already own over half of all US assets) with reduced healthcare and reduced American lifespans thanks to their gullibility and misdirected anger at decades of unrewarded increases in American productivity (US average hours of work per week are very high compared to that of most 1st world nations). &quot;Trickle down economics&quot; totally failed with Reagan, but the American educational system is so pathetic that not enough Americans know enough to not repeat such grave errors of history. US life expectancy has already gone down for the first time in history, and real wages have stagnated for decades while the &quot;American dream&quot; of being able to become wealthy by simply working hard is impossible without an unlikely dose of very rare luck (you need to be born rich).<br />And all this is a best case scenario. If Trump decides to play war games to distract from his corruption, the whole fragile planet can get drawn in.	UCYXp77H0RD8Ow3n2Hs40ztQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYXp77H0RD8Ow3n2Hs40ztQ	0

He thought it would be easy, which is why he was always criticizing Obama. He always said he would do it, but wouldn&#39;t explain how. Just look at Jared&#39;s jobs. They&#39;re all the lies Trump fed to the people to get elected, and he wants somebody to blame when all of the issues are out of his hands, when his promises aren&#39;t kept.

Ivanka is in it along with some other people who are the kids of the super rich and those kids are going to inherit a vast fortune. I remember that there was a friend of Jamie Johnson who spoke in the documentary about going to a top school and the fact that his grades dont matter because his family legacy insured that he would graduate.

It appears that this very <br />not so funny show is based on a lot of not so true, not so information. <br /> I let YouTube select my consumption selections. This was what came up <br />this morning. It is well written propaganda. When I was in the CIA, <br />this type of BS was referred to as Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern psychological operations (PSYOP). Here PsYOPS are taken to a very high level.<br /><br />This<br /> is serious. Google Michael Hastings, or Seth Rich. The Clintons have <br />killed hundreds of folks to cover up their sins and lies. You think <br />Putin is the only killer in politics today? The U.S. Government has <br />killed millions for not much more than generating profits for the <br />Military Industrial Complex. Vietnam was a war of convenience. the <br />Buddhists in South Vietnam were being persecuted by the U.S. backed <br />Catholics. The result was a civil war that we caused, promoted and <br />then, as in Iraq, walked out of creating a political vacuum, drawing in <br />the North Vietnamese Communists. Youtube has the truth on who killed <br />JFK. It is sad. Trump is not ready for the shit storm coming his way. <br /> If they cannot remove him with this bullshit, they will kill him. And <br />you folks laugh on..... America is lost to the Globalist Elite, <br />Rothschild, Bush, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Windsors, and on and on. You <br />poor fools will not stand a chance.......

So, if you were fooled into buying something ... or voting someone, it&#39;s ok.

Sure, a disproportionate number of them do, but I don't see them going on a crusade for brown hair or blue eyes. I haven't heard of a Jew in office who says that they must go on a Crusade for Yahweh to recapture the Egyptian prime ministership like Joseph or the Euphrates River Valley, promised to Abraham. If anything it's the Christian conservatives in the US claiming to be on Crusades for Jesus and explicitly or implicitly involving religion. Jewish nationalists do say that in Israel, but even then, the leftist and often secular Jews in Israel's parliament have dominated about as often as the nationalists.

Nothing really troubling seems to happen here. All the people are having great fun. There is a comedy show running on TV and nearly every american TV station is reporting about it. It’s fantastic. The show is with Donald Trump, the one who did The Apprentice, do you remember? But this show is much better. He&#39;s making fun of the POTUS. His inauguration speech was great, pure satire, you know! There are also episodes taken in the WH press conference room, where they have a funny guy called Sean Spicer. Here they are discussing the size of the inauguration crowd, wether a fence is a wall or still a fence; about tweets from Trump, who is still firing people; how to measure the quality of a healthcare bill by the size of the paper its printed on. Can you believe that, Mom? They are so democratic here, you know. The White House seems not to feel offended and even the Senat isn&#39;t upset. They are all enjoying it. It seems that they are all fascinated just like the people were when watching the Truman Show. I&#39;m just waiting for the spotlight to crash out of the sky. That&#39;s it, Mom, I have to go. Next time I&#39;ll write to you from Grrreat Brritten. Apparently they have a similar thing going on.

Gather them on the white house lawn during a global broadcast and shred them with a 50 Cal. Something that would make the Kennedy assassination look like a paper cut. <br /><br />For some additional shock and awe, perhaps wipe North Korea completely off the map without discussing it with anyone. I would like to see Bibi strapped to the blade of dozer and force Henry Kissinger&#39;s old ass to plow Mt. Hermon into a reflection pool. Anyway, these sell outs in Washington need to die a beautiful death, serving the country for once. <br /><br />If we don&#39;t stand now, our American dreaming is finished and we absolutely deserve to fall. We are seemingly no better than these scumbags &quot;representing&quot; us. I didn&#39;t want to accept it for many years, but sadly, it&#39;s the undeniable truth.

The story is being replicated by Breitbart and now Mark Levin is using the story (as a whiny little bitch he is) to trash on John Oliver.

To lump people together the way you just did is simply moronic. And for fucks sake, learn some basic grammar and spelling rules. "back to herd sheep you're being called" isn't a sentence, and is so lacking in any structure as to make the sentence's meaning a complete mystery.

For you to draw these conclusions, based on nothing, is simply stupid. You show real ignorance when you do so. Please, show me what evidence you have that I am simply saying things because I follow other people. You also say that I should "think for myself". I have done so in my conversations with you, and have come to realize that YOU are actually the one simply saying things because you heard them somewhere. By your silence, you've already admitted that you can't prove that "all politicians lie". Your response? You changed the subject. I can't find a better example of irony than you trying to tell me that I should think for myself, yet you don't realize that you yourself have simply taken something at face value that others have said: "all politicians lie." And AGAIN you left the actual conversation behind. Donald Trump is unprecedented. Never have we had so much evidence of a president lying and simply making things up than we have with him. The media doesn't know what to do. They don't have to work at finding this stuff. He says it right out loud for everyone! This is well documented. Should I send you some links, because you seem to be pretty oblivious to the shitstorm that surrounds him? I don't know how old you are, or what you remember. But NEVER has there been someone like him. I don't care how shit any other president was. You miss my argument completely. If I said things like "alternate facts" you'd laugh at me. Trump says it, and suddenly he's shitting gold. Are you really this fucking unaware of what is going on, and how completely fucking moronic this guy is? I ALSO said that Trudeau, my prime minister, is a light weight. But I'll take him over a fucking buffoon every day, and twice on Sundays. Part of being a leader is being tactful. And I can't think of anyone less tactful. I could go on and on, but I'm quite sure that you won't listen to anything I say, because unlike me, you've already made up your mind, and don't actually have any reasoning to back up anything you say.

Please try to focus on the conversation. Nice attempt at a bait and switch, though. The position is so much more subtle than you or he seem capable of understanding. Case in point, firing the director of the FBI while Trump is under investigation. The guy's a fucking clown, and it seems you share a clown car with him. And for fuck's sake, learn how to spell.

I understand everyone is caught up in the idea that most people are going to view things on the internet but there&#39;s still a large number of American citizens that don&#39;t have the internet and do have basic cable that doesn&#39;t include HBO.. Yes I&#39;m begging you to make Last Week Tonight more available. Your shows talk about VERY real issues and I seriously think more people need to be watching shows like this. Yes there&#39;s a lot of dumbasses in America and it probably will still, not change a damn thing or make people actually stand up for some change in our many issues but there&#39;s always the small chance more people will.

It was similar to how Trump is getting absolutely nothing done now.	UCS3SuLaUAm49utAsHI3Lt8Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS3SuLaUAm49utAsHI3Lt8Q	1	UggHnoRmVvTGMHgCoAEC	William Ridge Sr.

The only thing trump wanted to be president was to go in the history book to feed his ego. He's trying to tear down everything Obama did to make him feel he's better than Obama, but it's not ever going to happen. Obama has class, trump is just crass. Obama never went around grabbing females by their pussy. You can by pro Republican, but are you willing to except an Orange Turd in the Punchbowl in the White House rather than admit you elected a Narcissist moron mad Manboy. If that's true, you are as bad as trump himself. I am not pro Republican or pro Democrat, I'm Anti Stupid.

I ended up watching all the previous episodes that I never watched before starting it 2 years ago. <br /><br />The reason for my comment is, yes you can use the data to actually extract what people want to hear. It&#39;s called sentiment extraction. You collect data from various sources, social media is where people are discussing these day, Facebook, twitter etc and rank it up to see the most commonly discussed topics, and predict what should be said during the campaign. Obama did it and so did trump. <br /><br />I am a data scientist and do the same for my clients. Was a bit disappointed when you shrugged it off as something not possible. Anyhow, love the show and the perspective / research that comes with it. Keep on rocking!!!	UCVPAnJYRZsc_TYUdR0Ly1RQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVPAnJYRZsc_TYUdR0Ly1RQ	0

Open letter to the Speaker, House of Representatives of the United States of America, Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin Dear &quot;Mr.&quot; Ryan. I am taking the gloves off. I am a registered Independent from NH. Last year, I was dismayed to see the Republican Convention subject itself to the populist (I call it christianist extremist) trend, and choose a known fraud, inveterate liar, and (on my part, at least) suspected traitor, as nominee, because he used effective slogans. I considered you an element of sanity, when you said you couldn&#39;t support him, after publication of the tape with Billy Bush, for reasons of conscience. This was shattered when you withdrew your objections before the election. Your cover for the farce with Congressman Nunes completely eliminated any respect on my part. I have watched the recording you posted, of your speech before Congress in advance of the vote on the amended AHCA, and am not impressed. I must consider you a prime example of the partisan opportunism pervading your House at this time, and find it despicable. Though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s available to you, here is a copy of my posts in early March, on your first attempt at &quot;R&amp;R&quot;: &quot;Why is it, really that the Republican Party is so dead-set against the ACA? Because it also put mechanisms in place for <i>accountability</i>. Please remember that big-time insurer and pharma executives are among the <i>heaviest</i> contributors to the former&#39;s campaign chests. And of course said executives want to keep their obscene bonus levels and continue driving cost structures best described as a clipper ship trying to sail on the tips of it&#39;s masts. Another case of the Congress majorities creeping up the backside of their billionaire benefactors, helping them dump on Joe and Jane Normal!&quot; As a healthcare professional, I spent many years in countries with single-payer, government-regulated healthcare systems. The greatest difficulty, for me, was explaining how, despite building palaces to house bloated administrative multitudes, Europeans managed a 60% payout, against 40% costs, while America&#39;s health insurance structure ran the other way round. Now the House has passed a bill, without purview by the the OMB, or even by yourselves, that not only is worse than your first attempt, but hides a gift of many billions of dollars to your benefactors. I cry shame! You, sir, are a sorry excuse for a human male. I refuse to call you a man. Most sincerely, Eb Hoene, Somersworth P.S. Before anyone accuses me of anything else, I&#39;m Lutheran, my family goes back at least 900 years to first mention as Knights Templar, and we don&#39;t have a &quot;von&quot; because true aristocracy has no need of it. Our family&#39;s motto: Our hand to our friend, Our heart to our family, Our face to the foe. &quot;Dem Freund die Hand, Der Familie das Herz, Dem Feind die Stirn.&quot; In the original German.

Has she spent a lot of time in California, that I am unaware of ? It's not New York, it's not even Park Avenue New York. If I had to guess a region, I would say San Fernando Valley receptionist, someone who has developed a telephone voice. Or like Paris Hilton's voice. Did Ivanka spend a lot of time with that set, a few years ago ? It's not at all like her 15 year old self's voice, which was on show in the video above.

Both Eleanor Roosevelt and Margaret Thatcher were admonished by advisers to lower their "silly girl" vocal resonance and to speak firmly and definitively and to accentuate those words that gave their rhetoric strength and viability.

Anyone who didn&#39;t flunk out of high school could be fine after getting into Harvard.<br /><br />Of course, getting in in the first place is academically difficult... if you aren&#39;t a top athlete or fucking rich. Like, for a normal academic nonrich applicant, it&#39;s harder than getting into MIT--not only do you have to be an all-rounder rather than mostly being good at math &amp; science, but also some of your potential slots are being taken by dumb-as-shit athletes and rich kids.<br /><br />There also are some classes you can choose to take to challenge yourself. Math 55 is a famous freshman option for being mathematically challenging. And if you go into an engineering or science program, you can challenge yourself by cross-enrolling at MIT classes.<br /><br />But the minimum intelligence needed to skirt by at Harvard, passing or even getting all As in your classes, in, say, a business program, is roughly equivalent to that of the University of Alabama. Pathetic.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t believe me about athlete requirements, just look at the requirements here: <a href="http://www.gocrimson.com/information/recruiting/helpfulinfo">http://www.gocrimson.com/information/recruiting/helpfulinfo</a><br /><br />Before 2016, a GPA of 2.0 (a C _average_) was enough. Now they&#39;ve upped it to a 2.3 (a C+ average, oh no). You can be functionally braindead and still get into harvard as a top athlete. And the classes literally have to be easy so those functionally braindead athletes won&#39;t flunk out.	UCizHPWrr65SsrmNH_wlu7mw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCizHPWrr65SsrmNH_wlu7mw	0

Harry has even said that no one wants to be King when the Queen dies. our elections aren't for a single leader like US. we elect a party, not a person. we don't want one person making decisions and fucking it up, we'd rather have the security of knowing the entire party is a fuck up. UK and US have no one but each other now because they've both ROYALLY fucked up.	UCYXHhFEEfrWE0EZVrrHlrOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYXHhFEEfrWE0EZVrrHlrOg	1	Ugh7SxcBsPyz1ngCoAEC	marlyn badza

You Brits never have an opportunity to elect anyone but your local MP. You are "subjects" and "commoners" and pieces of shit to your "royals" and "lords" who never get elected but run the UK for their personal massive greed. Donald Trump can be voted out and must leave or be reelected in four years. You can never vote or get rid of the greedy criminal "royals." We don't take an oath to Donald Trump or sing our allegiance to him but you Brit to a decrepit "queen." Shame on you Shame on you for your and Brit stupidity.

UgiLezO4KldnL3gCoAEC	16	153	2017-05-02 18:00:08	Brooklyn Grace Sparks	Look man, I&#39;m going to level with you.... teens today are incredibly quick to side with issues, one way or another, based solely on the “facts” from whatever they happen to see in their Facebook feed, Instagram, Twitter feed, or various other social media. I know this from the teenagers that I am is raising, and they&#39;re peers. However, when you ask them to cite any resource for they&#39;re information, or even why they have taken the stance on the views they have taken, they cannot tell you. I get so many questions about history that it is ridiculous. (Mind you when I say history, I mean history from as long ago as why this country was founded, and as recent as who ran In our last presidential election) These are children, all armed with smartphones, that, for some reason, don&#39;t have the two seconds that it takes to Google simple History questions that now affect the current situation we&#39;re living in.<br /> Luckily, the one way that I have been able to get my teenagers to educate themselves on some of these issues is by watching your show. I realize that HBO is a busy Network, and you do not have time to cover every single history lesson that now applies to the current situation we are in, but please if you cover no other history that pertains to our current situation, please, PLEASE (again for emphasis) cover the Civil War. Since it is something that not even our president is educated about, it comes as no surprise to me that our teenagers are not educated about it. (Despite the fact they are required, atleast here, to take American and world history to graduate) These children, that in a matter of a few short years, will have the ability to vote and change our government. If the only way that we can get through to them is with a little “bad” language and the occasional dirty joke, I&#39;m willing to forego it. ( Let&#39;s I face it, in an age were they all have fetish porn at their fingertips, I&#39;m sure that any child like innocence they would of had lost, is long since gone) Any way to educate them, so they make better, more informed choices is worth the time, and effort to convey said message.<br /> I feel like it is worth noting that I say all these things as a stay-at-home, Arkansan mother in a suburban town, of less than 5,000 people, that is about as culturally diverse as Iceland. I didn’t just come here from another region, I have lived here all my life, as my parents did before me. I get called a liberal snowflake DAILY, because of my veiws on ANYTHING, that does not call fall in line with the typically southern white housewife. “How dare I want” things like gender and racial equality.<br /> Now I realize that not all young people may be the same, and that by merely writing this I am asking for trolls. But, I find it distressing that the lack of knowledge, is not solely confinded to young people where I live. Many vehicles here are plastered in Confederate flags, with the word “Heritage not Hate” written over them as some sort of justification. (You know, “Cuz this is ‘Merica damn it”)Many people whose opinions have clashed with my own, will express, that because I feel these are offensive, I “must not know my history, because the civil war had NOTHING to do with slavery”. <br /> So, yes, I am asking, that a BRITISH man,appear on an American network, and talk about the civil war and its impact on our current governmental situation. You can even throw in the catheter cowboy to further spread the message to Our (and I say this with much sorrow) President. Because, I fear that with our current political regime, and the ever widening gap between libral and conservative, we may be forced to relive it.

A lot of Bernie supporters chose to stay home or vote 3rd party out of pique simply because they didn't get their own way. Those votes for Stein mattered in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania & Michigan as Trump won in those 3 states by less than 1% handing him the presidency! You can make all the excuses you want about the DNC being biased or unfair but it doesn't change the 'fact' Bernie didn't get enough votes to defeat Clinton, that's the truth. Lots of people had worked hard for years on campaigns for the Democrats from the grass roots level up yet millennials thought they were entitled after supporting Sanders for just a few months & they also ignored the fact Bernie was an Independent not even a democrat. It was a sad case of many millennials not being able to see the bigger picture after Sanders lost & the consequences of not voting for Clinton.

I'm an active member of my school debate team, and I've long since gotten into the habit of researching and scanning the news every day. I understand that maybe where you live in, you're surrounded by conservative teenagers that maybe don't research their opinions, but that doesn't mean that you need to label my generation as a group of bumbling, brainwashed idiots. I agree with Triatan in that it was your generation that was the majority of votes in this election, and therefore, your generation that got him elected. Maybe you're right in that one generation cannot be singled out and blamed for Trump winning, but yours definitely did the most damage. I grew up in an era where George W Bush was president, another mistake that you guys have created. With him and Trump making decisions that will surely impact all of us in the future, you guys have screwed this up. Really bad. It's actually people that share your opinion and label my generation as stupid and naive that keep us from electing people like Bernie Sanders. He had a lot of young votes, and he could have had more, had the voting age not been so high because of older generations not giving us the power to give the, to him because they thought we couldn't handle it. Times are changing, and our teenagers are being held to higher and higher standards, making them smarter and smarter. Our young adults are becoming just that- adults in younger bodies. It's time to let go of these old fashioned, conservative thoughts, which are what got Trump elected in the first place.

No one can ask that you do anything more than your best; the maturity and thoughtfulness of your post tells me that this is something which the country sorely needs at this time. I hope you'll consider stepping up to act as an example and role model to your peers, giving them a voice which needs to be, and will be, heard.

Your skill set in technology and use of social media puts many older campaign workers to shame, and has become a most important one in reaching and motivating your slightly older peers. You can play a role in bringing out many more votes than any individual can cast.

I hate the way things are right now although I know that is no excuse to act in ignorance. The thing is that teens really don't know who to trust anymore for good reason too because everything seems to be going to hell. Adults who voted for Trump clearly aren't trust worthy and the line between church and state is getting more blurry in journalism. This makes the process of fact checking much more difficult than normal and some of that is our fault when we let emotions override rational thought. It's hard to act under any emotion other than visceral disgust for everything this administration does.

Look kid (which I have to assume is true since you can't yet vote ) I get you are unhappy, and I did not vote for the douche either. Now far as "my generation screwing things up" I don't know that any one generation can be blamed for buying the propaganda. Also, what I wrote wasn't really about the presidential election, but more about how teens will take anything that runs across their need feed as fact in stead of taking the two seconds it takes to fact check.

Our youngsters are ignorant and impressionable, and they're being raised by ignorant and impressionable adults. Phrases such as, Trump Train!" can be heard throughout the halls of my school, and the people living near me praise President Trump like he's a deity. It's almost scary, and something should change. You're right, a small history lesson may be a good start.	UCfQ1Ts7cWd_i_NR3Ag3bkvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQ1Ts7cWd_i_NR3Ag3bkvQ	1	UgiLezO4KldnL3gCoAEC	Brooklyn Grace Sparks

Take ancient Greece , the macedonic king Philip&#39;s II son Alexander the Great not only was a good successor but took tiny empire and changed it into an enormous kick ass empire. The dude was practically unstoppable and he stopped only when his soldiers got too tired of winning and just wanted to go home. But and this is where Nepotism will work, Philip the second was an amazing father in the essence that he gave to young Alexander the best tutor Greece could offer at the time, Aristotle. Aristotle was the philosopher that single handed laid the foundation of modern thinking. So yes when your education is that stellar and not just has a title that is practically meaningless like &quot;Harvard&quot; then yes Nepotism can do wonders. Unfortunately Nepotism rarely works that well but is not because of itself but because of how politics work.	UCJMkk_HLknuhO6kk6LLBHcg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJMkk_HLknuhO6kk6LLBHcg	0

Most of what the main stream left and right say are just fear tactics aimed at making us distrust each other.

It is a learned behaviour. Example Vince Mcmahon Jr., far more successful than his father, but considered a lying douche bag by most of the non-wwe business. Vince McMahon Sr. known as someone who built his business on a handshake. His word was gold and highly thought of by his competitors. Jr. inherited no integrity from his father but profited far beyond his father. .Although I must say it looks like the Trump boys share their father's integrity or rather complete lack of it. Let's see who else, Kent and Eric Hovind. Integrity is a lost value. The briefest look at Wall St, should illuminate that.

UgjrM3Bm_HrSKngCoAEC	0	0	2017-04-30 22:01:41	First Name Last Name	Hi, I&#39;ve tried sending the following material, but have received only a notice that it was deleted without reading it. So, I apologize, but now I have to resort to YouTube commenting to get attention on the topic. Hopefully this issue will gain traction, but I understand that it may devolve into Hitler arguments before getting any attention. <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m a fourth year medical student.<br />I have an idea for Mr Oliver, and I have a feeling it is a subject which he can cover and provide ample discussion. I understand this may not be the best way to communicate, but it is worth a try. March 17th is known as Match Week in the US, a time when fourth year medical students are matched to a residency program. There are a shortage of residency programs, creating a bottleneck on the road to becoming a practicing physician. Each year there are calls to train more and more doctors to alleviate the shortage, and in response, many states have opened medical schools. This action creates more MDs, but does not create more practicing physicians because the number of residency positions has not increased since 1997. The number has remained fixed for the past 20 years due to the fact that residency funding is tied with Medicare - a divisive issue in American politics. <br />Yet many Americans, in fact many lawmakers, are unaware of this issue as it becomes quickly buried in the debate over Medicare funding. So, while more students are going into medical school each year, the number of trained physicians remained fixed, despite a growing demand. Further on the subject, the physician shortage is primarily in preventive care, which has become unattractive to many due to the increasing cost of medical education and the decreasing salary for general practitioners. As for myself, I have successfully matched and will become a fully trained physician, but many others have not been so fortunate. Each year, thousands of MDs are denied a residency position, simply because there is not enough funding for training. Many of these young doctors are forced to work at low-income jobs until the next year&#39;s Match, only to face the problem once again when there are more MDs than positions to be filled.So, while the nation needs more doctors, until this issue is addressed, the number of new physicians will remain fixed and many qualified doctors will go without jobs. It is truly heartbreaking.I know this will not likely reach Mr Oliver, but it is a topic that desires discussion on the national stage. I believe he has the ability to cover the issue in a way which will bring the topic to the forefront.	UCa1UTg94F5L9dsiIccGLsKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa1UTg94F5L9dsiIccGLsKg	0

Two of its members are ironically former Development Bank directors (responsible themselves of part of the huge debt).<br />-Current governor blocked the publicly acclaimed audit of the debt, saying that &quot;the courts will take care of it&quot;.<br />-Just last night Law 938 was passed late at night, which cuts many of the essential rights acquired by the public sector workers.<br />-On May 1st (next Monday!) the entire archipelago is going on a &quot;Paro Nacional&quot; or &quot;National Boicot&quot;, with major manifestations throughout the country, especially in San Juan. It is the first time a painfully divided Puerto Rico unites to face its corrupt government. Even the Churches Council, which represents most major religious groups in PR, has joined the event.<br /><br />We really need any coverage we can from US media (meant to help). And you did a great job last time. Plus you have a lot of Puerto Rican fans. Do it for Lin-Manuel Miranda&#39;s sad-puppy face for God&#39;s sake! Please.

If Ivanka were actually running for a political position without the help of a famous father but with several decades of experience, they would argue she doesn&#39;t have the &quot;right look&quot;, and her &quot;on message&quot; poise would be proof that she must not be genuine.

Her moves to personally benefit by her father's Presidency are clear and damning. The China stuff, her importation of 100,000 to 200,000 pairs of shoes per year, produced for her label by factories which it turns out are regularly and severely violating Chinese labour laws and the grant of 5 trademarks in China which had gone unruled on for 3 1/2 years until just after her father was elected and had just met with the Chinese premier both speak to her moral character. Her book "Working Women" speaks to her intellectual substance. Bland positivity isn't the same as authorial talent. She appeared uncomfortable (maybe a little sickened) delivering that line at the Miss Teen USA pageant, and embarrassed by her fathers answer on The View. Social intelligence and some self-awareness, that's it. I wonder what her view of her husbands apparent connection to and possible obligation to Vnesheeconombank over 666 5th Avenue, among other possible problematic interactions, might be. If she has some moral centre, not good. Otherwise if she doesn't she is as compromised and irredeemable as the rest.

Being educated doesn't make you an "elitist" and not knowing what an electoral vote is, or believing that we should just not vote at all is NOT 'cool'. It's stupid. Plain and simple. If more people would have voted Trump would not have been elected but too many people thought their vote didnt matter and just sat on their ass. You don't need to go to Harvard to know how our electoral system works - they went over that in high school and it's only been talked about EVERY 4th YEAR OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

Ughp9MyuFmGSUngCoAEC.8RwNrFUO3Xu8TjGunfN-OW		1	2017-06-13 01:51:55	Admiral Piett	Purpose for the electoral college: The Electoral College was created for two reasons. The first purpose was to create a buffer between population and the selection of a President. The second as part of the structure of the government that gave extra power to the smaller states. (http://www.historycentral.com/elections/Electoralcollgewhy.html) It was created as a buffer of sorts between the voters and the selection of the candidates to become president. I know that sounds confusing but I found it easier to explain the first reason like this: The Founding Fathers created the electors to make sure that the most qualified president, in their eyes, was elected into office. Now I know that many of you believe that Trump wasn't qualified or whatever, but it was more to ensure that if the population was manipulated or duped or the votes were tampered with, that the person who would be on the success side of that wouldn't be in office. The electors, on the other hand, met only like once or twice together I believe. That means that a large group of electors wouldn't be manipulated. As for giving extra power to the smaller states, its more simple than the first reason. So the number of electoral votes you have is the exact number of seats you have in Congress. i think the number of representatives in Congress you have for a state depends on the population in that state (I'm not 100% sure though). Now this creates a huge, or yuge, problem; California for example has 53 seats in Congress, or House of Reps. This means they have 53 electoral votes, the most out of any state. It is followed by Texas, New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Now if a candidate won JUST California and Pennsylvania, he/she would have more electoral votes than all of the 'middle states" excluding Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Thus the electoral college system was implemented to stop such a victory.	UCtUlVCQx8jY1UckgRRiHszQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtUlVCQx8jY1UckgRRiHszQ	1	Ughp9MyuFmGSUngCoAEC	Ajinkya Gadgil

The country was split almost 50/50, according to the polls made public by Faux News and other media outlets. Congress put Trump in office with the electoral college, a dated process established in the US constitution by the founding fathers. The state designated electors cast their chose of president based on the country's vote, but the electors need not adhere to public opinion. In other words, the electoral college is a loop hole for the 1% to always occupy the white house...

The reality is grade school and high school do not prepare kids for life; they prepare them for college, which is too expensive and many will not attend or finish. Beyond that, too many parents are forced to choose the least terrible school in their district. We all know people who have access to good schools get a "better" education and lead a more prosperous life. So, they are seen as elitists.

A lot of the more marketable male vocalists fall into that category. Timbre similar to a less emoted version of Kenneth from 30 rock. New Yorkish accent, annunciation, rhythm and pacing (and a bit a drawl) reminiscent of a younger Tom Cruise. I don't know why he avoids being recorded now, except for the obvious reasons. Now I know what he sounds like.	UC1QjvVysKnpDxz1-i-BbhUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1QjvVysKnpDxz1-i-BbhUA	1	UggrLML6faoKY3gCoAEC	AT 01

Families then make between $10-$30,000 a year ALREADY qualify for &#39;care for kids&#39; and other free daycare for supplemented childcare. It&#39;s the middle income families that make between $30-$70,000 a year that need tax incentives for daycare because it&#39;s the middle income families that do not get any help and are paying the most in chikdcare. Ivanka had a great childcare write off policy, but her usual no one wants to help the middle class.

A recent investigation by PETA Asia into three large fur farms in China — which produces most of the world’s fur — reportedly found slaughterhouse workers hitting rabbits on the head with the back of a knife, hanging them upside down and slitting their throats. Almost all of the rabbits still kicked and twitched as their throats were slit and many were even skinned alive. Footage also allegedly revealed rabbits living in filthy wire cages filled with feces with no reliable access to water.<br /><br /><a href="https://animalpetitions.org/128927/stop-selling-fur-from-rabbits-tortured-and-skinned-alive/">https://animalpetitions.org/128927/stop-selling-fur-from-rabbits-tortured-and-skinned-alive/</a>	UCZWnzgxnkveHeEnjyQrGE7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWnzgxnkveHeEnjyQrGE7A	0

I dont know why John oliver kept talking about how &quot;good looking they are&quot;.....sorry but there are not. I guess they compare them with trump. Ivanka and Jared are playing people fool. Being quiet and being a woman doesnt mean you are nice or capable. Being a young man and not saying stupid things like trump doesnt mean you are a nice person and capable to deal with the main problems of a country. Trump voters are stupid.

There are many other events happening around the world but the creators of this show continue to pick topics that obvious and boring. We understand that there is a lot wrong with this administration and we are writing our congressmen and women with our opinions but it comes to a point where it&#39;s beating a dead horse. I have kept watching, hoping that it would make a turn to more relevant subject of conversation to no avail. One unsub doesn&#39;t mean much on a channel as large as this but one thing I have learned from John Oliver is that every voice does matter, even if it doesn&#39;t feel like it. This is my protest vote and hopefully when I come back next season things will have changed.	UCf81aeObvwQiSYPzbT5aFfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf81aeObvwQiSYPzbT5aFfg	0

They trade in precious metals in an unregulated, bazaar-like marketplace. It might as well be some kind of libertarian/anarco-capitalistic paradise. Also, insulting children's books in the same sentence as such grammar mistakes as using a possessive "socialist's" instead of the plural really makes me think you are either trolling or functionally illiterate.

And ALL he needs to do is keep his mouth shut, to look brilliant next to donnie. And why would we suspect bias on Ivanka's part, when speaking of her father and husband?!? And why the hell should we care about her opinion? She's got the judgement that made her think, "I've got all the money I could need, I've got no financial problems. Why don't I have plastic surgery on my nose, my lips, my ass, my breasts? Oh, and maybe I should pose for some pornography? That sounds like a good idea. Whatever could happen in the future that might make that seem like a bad move?" Only in America, would anyone think that a man whose daughter AND his wife had careers in pornography, is approppriate as leader of our nation. T supports are so crass that they think that makes him MORE qualified.	UCYFmLvtumBCCM3I6ZgVxduw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYFmLvtumBCCM3I6ZgVxduw	1	UgifmvrGfeaL7XgCoAEC	edward woods

Unfortunately the person making the solid argument falls in to the trap of having to justify themselves as well as fight the latter(uniformed retort) when the orginal question gets lost in the mad tumble down the rabbit hole. This deflection is why nothing happens on one side and everything happens on the other till the next time someone asks another question and the answer can be "Well I'm not Hitler". Ridiculous.

We have a really worrisome problem that has nothing to do with being conservative or liberal.

They look good only in contrast to the orange homunculus and his travesty of an administration, and that&#39;s because the bar has been set very low. Their involvement in the administration still reeks (rightfully) of nepotism and the potential advancement of self interests. We have yet to see when, and if, they&#39;re actually gonna create any meaningful positive change. So right now, I&#39;m saving any positive regards or evaluation toward them until they actually prove they belong there, running the government.

So how could VP Mike Pence be there when he is either on an airplane flying to his next destination or currently sitting down and talking with the leaders of South Korea and Japan to discuss North Korea&#39;s latest actions and missile tests.

For example, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton were never really much of friends. Hamilton couldn't stand Burr. They kind of exaggerated how well they got along in the musical because it made the betrayal seem a lot more powerful. Miranda himself explains some of this. Still a freaking great musical.

But just from the 100% clear historical facts in the musical (eg. the Federalist Papers) you can tell that he is not a person who likes to stay quiet. Even if all you know about Alex is from the musical, you'd still have a *much* more accurate image of him than the reporter did. Also, a quick google search shows that the image his personality that is given in the musical is indeed accurate.

UgigHyjsurHtUXgCoAEC.8Ro-a4WK47k8RwaNipa_jl		4	2017-04-29 12:58:06	Joshua Williams	@waltzingangel Yes, I assume that people who are quoting a musical to make an outlandish argument on subject matter they are otherwise completely 100% ignorant on are, in fact, deriving their opinion of Hamilton's personality from the musical. I would wager that, if asked, they would also believe Hamilton's influence actually prevented Aaron Burr from becoming president (which any of us with actual historical knowledge know is false; their duelling quarrel resulting from a gubernatorial contest). It's common sense, try some or take Burr's character's advice on talking less.	UCoQIIOeizuuV3_zZmLo8OkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoQIIOeizuuV3_zZmLo8OkA	1	UgigHyjsurHtUXgCoAEC	Liz Hensel

With no creative liberties taken? We all believe that people singing and dancing in the streets is normal way to explain feelings and actions; also, we believe that writers have no opinions or bias or agendas? Instead of assuming he/she is wrong about Hamilton because their facts came from a musical, do some basic research. Use that instead of your ignorant opinion to support your argument.

They dont understand that when whites are a minority there will be zero blacks, zero muslims and zero hispanics marching and demanding anything for you. The white race is so anti white, so anti America that i can only figure they have been brainwashed so much, that they can no longer think for themselves.<br /> All races stand up for their own interests but the white race. All races work together to help their own races but white race liberals seem to hate their own kind. Take LaRaza, the race, these people come right out and tell you that the western states is theirs and they are taking it back. You have blacks that feel pissed off by the fact that we have a white man as president now. The black race wants to rule over the white race, get it straight. The muslims are very honest when they say all America will be under sharia law. Its like white liberals cant understand these people are not kidding.<br /> The jewish controlled education system and hollywood demonizes the white man constantly, they do everything they can to destroy our morals, turning so many into freaks, filled with hate and violence for America and their own race. The jews have told us many many times that they want a brown race and to end the white Christians for good. Both world wars where to have white Christians killing white Christians, and do we study that? No bbut we hear non-stop about the jews and the holocaust. We dont hear about the millions of white German women and children that were carpet bombed in Dresden and two other major cities. We dont learn about the babies that were melted to the asphalt roads or the boiling white people burned to death.<br /> There is only two things whites are taught 1. blacks were slaves and whites were pure evil and 2. the holocaust. Most whites dont understand that black race muslim Moors invaded Spain and took millions as slaves and to them back to Egypt and sold them, that is why so many arabs are lighter now. they dont hear about the muslims that for centuries wuld sail up the coasts and take people by force to be slaves. the white race young women were prized by the blacks, at least until they got old. <br /> Shows like this one make it seem that everything they say, their jewsih agenda is the right thing, and only idiot racists would not understand. America was 90% white race until the jews changed the laws in 1965 and their goal has always been to destroy the white, non-jewish race. The most racists and evil of all people are the globalists who admit their goals to end whiteness.<br /> It is time that whites wake up and look around. Millions of whites now live in their cars or vans, millions of them are in poverty, most whites are living below most people on section 8 housing which is free for blacks and hispanics and refugees. The white race biggest problem is they think other races think just like they do. They dont. Most races hate the white race for many reasons. Maybe it is because 98% of every single invention ever invented was invented by white race men from America and Europe. 98% or more. Chinese invented gun powder and guns. To stand for you own race is not racism, it doesnt make you a nazi or skinhead. It makes you human. Once the white race is a minority in America, it will be to late. Demand the stop to white genocide, demand the stopping of all non-white immigration for a time. The blacks that rule in African countries do not work, the lands where hispanics rule, dont work, even the land where Chinese rule doest work for most Chinese. The only land that is non-white that works is Japan.	UCJjvZx1K_ljpITfaVb4SxoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjvZx1K_ljpITfaVb4SxoQ	0

Either in preparation for a coming clash between the president and Clinton's clique, or due to bipartisan dissatisfaction over him. Your whole argument rests on your perception of Trump's intent. Had Trump intended to actually obstruct justice, he would have sabotaged Mueller's appointment. You agree that Mueller's more of a hardass, and I'd say Comey is so tangled up in politics that he's utterly unfit to handle this case. So, by firing Comey, Trump actually launched the investigation forward, and Mueller being in charge means the result will be more reliable. How is that obstruction of justice? It seems like the exact opposite. Isn't this what a president SHOULD do? Trump just fired someone who helped him in the past and could be perceived as biased, and approved someone that is impartial and unbiased. Trump asking Comey to stand down is a mere allegation to my knowledge, something just stated by Comey. I wouldn't trust a man's word about his political opponent, especially right after he ousted him. Trump said he didn't say anything of the sort, why should I trust Comey over Trump? One's an intelligence officer, the other is the world's most talented used cars salesman, I'm not sure which one is more prone to lying.

Doesn't look like an obstruction of justice to me, especially since Mueller was appointed. He seems a lot more like a hardass than Comey. EDIT: Sorry, I missed this part: "This "whataboutism" excuse train has only so many tracks." This isn't whataboutery. Trust me, I come from the former Eastern Bloc, nobody does whataboutery better than us, this wasn't it. This information is relevant. If the Dems' narrative that Comey purposefully co-operated with Trump is true, then why is Trump firing him an obstruction of justice? If he was on Trump's side, Comey would have purposefully sabotaged any investigation, in an effort to help Trump. So, Trump just fired somebody the Dems disliked, and would have been a hindrance to any investigation against Trump. That is according to their own narrative. How is this a bad thing then? "No Dems were NOT saying Comey was a "Russian Collaborator" Dems were saying he violated the Hatch Act." And if he did violate it, what was his motivation? Backing Trump. In the Dems' narrative, Trump is a Russian asset, according to them any random Joe with half a braincell can see that, so the FBI's leadership MUST know about it. Therefore, Comey is a Russian collaborator. Do your politicians need to explicitly spell out everything? "And if none of that is true then why on Earth did Trump fire him?" Well, maybe it's the Central European side of me talking (again, our political culture is a bit different, a lot more propaganda, power plays and machiavellian backstabbing, a lot less transparency), but it looks quite obvious: Comey didn't want to appear as if he was Trump's lapdog, and/or didn't want to have a part in an extensive personal purge of the current establishment, so a deal was struck between him, Trump, and a representative of Clinton's clique. Trump wouldn't appoint a special prosecutor or go on the offensive against Clinton over her ties to the barbaric monarchies of the Gulf States', over the obvious embezzlement and laundering of money in the Clinton Foundation, or over her betrayal of the U.S.'s state interests and those of their NATO allies by being complicit in the creation of the migrant crisis. In return, Clinton would fade into the background, which explains her relative silence directly after the election, and Comey would consider the whole thing to be closed. However, with Clinton's attempt to actively return to politics and to undermine Trump's legitimacy by attributing her own defeat to "Russian WikiLeaks", the deal was crossed, Comey, either due to remaining adamant about his position, or just simply to mop up the remnants was fired, and the propaganda machine is being started up against Clinton, which is why we started hearing about the thing with Seth Rich. Quite simple, isn't it?	UC5ROLaHmt2anRB0ejr_FcMg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ROLaHmt2anRB0ejr_FcMg	1	Uggo72NsVox--ngCoAEC	SkyHigh5280

Comey wasn't fired due to "allegations of Russian conspirators". I'm sorry, but hasn't like half the Democratic Party called for Comey's resignation? Now they have it, and now it's somehow "muh Russia"? What's the logic here? The narrative being weaved by the Democrats is that Comey was a Russian collaborator, who actively helped Trump achieve the presidency by undermining Clinton, who then was fired by Trump because he wanted to reveal his Russian ties thus undermining his presidency. I'm sorry, but do you honestly not see that something doesn't add up in this narrative? "...message from the donald himself threatening Comey that he better not have tapes of their conversation, does he not realise twitter is a public domain and that everyone sees the message? " Maybe American intelligence agencies should stop illegally surveilling their own citizens and those of their allies, so that such suspicions aren't brought up. The U.S. illegally tapped into Merkel's communications, do you honestly find it unbelievable that they would have illegally surveilled Trump during whatever these conversations were? Trump, by turning the public attention towards them in advance, pre-empts any potential "accidental leaks" to the press, not to mention that he has good reason to do so, considering he has been "incidentally" surveilled by the CIA in the past out of obvious political consideration. "With the border wall thing, the senate held healthcare hostage by saying every dollar spent on healthcare will also be spent on the wall, even though the president promised that mexico will pay for it." Wait, did people actually expect that he would walk up to the president of Mexico, and give him a check with the wall's price on it? I thought it was obvious that he was going to make them "pay for it" by being a lot more harsh in trade negotiations. "I can understand your argument on the blind trust, in a perfect world that would make sense." No, it makes sense, in any world. What sort of idiot would elect a man to be president, while not even trusting him to put state interests first? "Yes, I know I'm putting the nuclear codes in your capable hands, along with the power to effectively wage war through executive orders and without congressional approval, but first I'm going to need you to sign this paper, just to make sure you're not going to abuse your executive powers to manipulate the market, and provide your company with favourable property prices." Do you honestly not see how ridiculous that is? If you're going to arm your president with such power, yet need such childish restrictions, you might as well press reset and start over. Either go back to the early days, with the president not being much more than a glorified general and minister of foreign affairs, with the states actually taking care of most of the business, or overhaul your whole country and culture to fit the new model. "He is decreasing tax for the richest people and removing (or trying to) inheritance tax which would only benefit people such as himself. With all he is doing to further enrich the rich..." Again, trickle down economics, Trump might actually believe in them. Even if the concept doesn't function, and currently in the U.S. I'm under the impression it doesn't, Hanlon's razor dictates this is incompetence at worst in lack of any proof that says otherwise. Also, I fundamentally disagree with the notion of inheritance tax, so I'm not going to fault Trump for trying to do away with it. The rich, in general, are extremely overtaxed in the West for no good reason, yet they barely receive additional representation for it. They're not being "enriched", less of their money is being taken away by the state, which would give nothing in return for it. "...not to mention putting many big oil company lobbiest and wallstreet bankers in powerful position..." Again, due to the U.S.'s reliance on this absolute and all-encompassing capitalism, as I see it, it's more akin to a giant conglomerate than a normal state. These are the people capable of, and interested in representing state interests, you should be more interested in making sure they do so, than in excluding them from power. Well, that, or change up the whole system. Partway solutions rarely work. "To me he seems like the worst president in my lifetime" Seriously? I mean I don't know how old you are, but: I assume you were alive for Bill Clinton, who opened the doors towards the Chinese communists and that butcher Jiang Zemin, who royally fucked up Somalia, who walked all over George H.W. Bush's policy by idiotically deciding that Saddam needed to be overthrown, and who was absolutely useless in Yugoslavia. Then you had Bush, who fucked up... well, pretty much every single thing he touched, except for Western Africa. I assume you're not going to argue about him. And then you had Obama, probably the most authoritarian U.S. president since the height of the Cold War (I don't mind that, but I understand you guys care about democracy :D), who constantly overstepped his role and bypassed the legislative body, under whom the CIA, the NSA, and God only knows what other agencies have illegally surveilled citizens of the U.S. and NATO allies in unprecedented manners and magnitudes, who went back on all his significant promises and betrayed his voters, who waged prolonged illegal wars against several countries, the majority of which served the interests of the barbaric sunni monarchies of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and who transformed the U.S. military interventinos into high-tech wars of terror. Trump was racist towards Mexicans? Tell that to the Afghani 6-year-old, whose entire extended family was wiped out because they attended a wedding with 2 possible Taliban militants, which then got hit by one of Obama's drone strikes. All in all, unless you were around for Reagan and H.W., Trump is probably the best president of your life, purely by virtue of being in office for under half a year, and thus not having the time to fuck up as much as his predecessors did.

Uggo72NsVox--ngCoAEC.8RnR6-pgw7s8SdYSQKCrez		0	2017-05-16 23:58:22	RacconAndMT	pvftr Sorry about double-posting again, I thought Youtube removed character limits a couple years back, but apparently not :P "Like in the early campaign when he said that most mexicans are rapists and drug dealers..." I don't recall him ever saying that most Mexicans criminals. I recall him saying that some of them are, and some of them are good people. He's a president, not the head of a charitable organisation. Crime rates amongst hispanic immigrants are significantly higher than amongst U.S. citizens, therefore letting hispanic immigrants into the country, while knowing that he can do nothing to temper the crime rates, would be nothing short of treason. Now I'm all for the establishment of the militarised police state capable of tempering those crime rates, but I assume you prefer democracy with less immigration over that. Also, while I don't know much about the inner workings of the Mexican government, what Trump said, that Mexico is "sending" drug dealers, rapists, etc., might also very well be true. The Ukrainians have pulled the same shit in the past with my country, Algeria and Tunisia are doing it to Italy and Germany, not to mention that the U.S. has been severely screwed over by Cuba in 1980 in such a way. Again, I'm no expert on Mexican politics, but what Trump said is not unheard of, and I certainly wouldn't be surprised, knowing how corrupt Latin American politics is, and how big a sway the cartels hold in Mexico. "...or when he told the crowd to punch protesters and that he'll pay the medical bills..." I assumed that was a joke. However, even if it wasn't, I don't blame him, judging by how violent and, quite frankly, barbarically his "protestors" have acted in the past, and especially since then. The U.S. government is neglecting its duties when not at the very least violently dispersing crowds of rioters, especially when they're publicly demanding violence, be that directed towards Trump, police officers, or white people in general. If the government refuses to protect its own people, the people will protect themselves. "...or when he tried to ban muslims from traveling to america." He did no such thing, there was a temporary travel ban on certain nations, which were either exporters of terrorism, absolute hellholes, and one of them is being run by a genocidal madman. Also, considering the dominant attitudes of the Muslim world, unchecked immigration from there is a security concern, and Trump is right to limit it. Constitutional rights don't apply to non-citizens, especially when universally applying them threatens citizens. That is not "racism" or "xenophobia", that is a president doing his job. "Heck even republican house representative admitted that "it was a textbook definition of racism..." Do you often trust the Republican house representatives? :P Also, isn't a significant faction of the GOP Trump's political enemy? "...when trump said a jjudge couldn;t properly do his work due to his Mexican heritage. " Now let me preface this by saying that I'm not familiar with the particular judge. If he's just a regular old U.S. citizen with a Mexican grandpa, then yeah, that's total bullshit, though it was probably a tactic to prolong a trial, not actual racism. However, if the judge considers himself Mexican first, has active connections with Mexican organisations in the U.S., with Mexican citizens, if he's a Mexican citizen himself, etc., then that is a very good reason. Have you seen the shit coming out of some of those organisations? They're actively undermining the American state, demonising the general population, and are active in political agitation. Quite frankly, I don't understand why the U.S. lets them keep running. I'm sorry, but Trump has been rather hostile towards the Mexican state during his campaign, and letting a Meixcan "nationalist" (let's call him that, for lack of a better term) preside over one of his cases would be idiotic. It's obvious there's a possible conflict of interest there, and the judge may skew the verdict due to political motivations, or purely personal emotions. Letting someone like that pass judgement over Trump would be letting a former KKK grand dragon pass judgement over a black man, saying "he's not prejudiced, it's just his culture!" To reiterate, if the judge had not been active in such organisations, then Trump's claim is total bogus, but it's more likely a tactic on his part, based on this political consideration, and not racism. By the way, if I'm not being rude by asking, why is "RACISM!" the first thing that always seems to come to your mind? "Your" as in not you, the person, "you" as in Anglo-Saxons, especially Americans (I assume you are one). There's obviously a possibility for political motivation in this case, it could be a tactic by Trump based on the insinuation of, or a legitimate claim based on the existence of such political motivation, so why is racism the first place people's minds go over there? It's probably the least likely explanation, especially considering I haven't heard about Trump having a problem with Mexicans any time before his campaign.

The plan is that their emissions levels will steadily rise until sometime between 2020 and 2030, after which they will slowly start declining. Not the best plan, but at least they're sticking to it for now. However, China is extremely unstable. Their GDP growth bubble is artificially manufactured (I assume you heard about their ghost towns and enforced highway-building projects, with the nail houses and all), and it's about to burst. They can barely afford to pay their army, tensions within the party haven't been this high since the Cultural Revolution, dissent is widespread amongst the population, they're facing a demographic nightmare as the one child policy has resulted in their youth not being able to pay for their elderly, and in a lack of women due to the selective murder and abandonment of female infants and children, and there's an extensive political purge being carried out by the government. If Xi Jinping's faction comes out on top, then yes, they might just direct their energies towards more "peaceful" efforts, improve living standards, and meet the plans by starting to reduce CO2 emission within a decade, though even if everything goes fine, that's still going to be a daunting task in the inner parts of the nation. The shining coastal cities are not the whole of China, and getting the people and cities further inland to stop depending on coal won't be an easy job. If the hardliners of Jiang Zemin's clique come out on top, we can expect a rearmament effort, the resumption of their disgusting policies (and I hope that the Manchurian death camps getting fired up again, and harvesting the organs of Falun Gong practitioners would draw international attention and an armed intervention against China this time around), along with a focus on increasing production by any means necessary, and walking all over any treaties about the environment. If neither one wins, and the whole wretched system comes crashing down, God only knows what will happen. However, I'm pretty sure CO2 emission levels will be the last thing people are concerned about. Even if everything goes well, I doub they'll be able to hold themselves to the plan. The uncertainty of this situation is rather irritating, seeing how China produces about as much CO2 as the U.S., the EU nations and Russia combined. I don't know what the official plans are for India, however, their coal consumption has spiked during the last 2 years. I assume that wasn't the plan. Also, India is rather unstable, with a maoist terrorist organisation running rampant in the South-Eastern part of the subcontinent, widespread dissatisfaction in the Southern half of the country towards the Delhi leadership, not to mention the obvious resistance from Muslims towards the Hindu nationalist leadership. On top of that, tensions with Pakistan have been on the rise. If India faces a massive insurgency, a general crisis, or God forbid an armed conflict against Pakistan and thus the Sunni monarchies, I doubt they'll concern themselves much with global warming. I don't care much about what the publicly stated views of Trump are, as long as his policy is consistent, which so far it has been. Wasn't it Clinton that said that you should always have a separate public and non-public opinion? As long as he sets a goal and sticks to it while it benefits his country, I don't care about what he says publicly. Also, when has Trump flip-flopped on NATO and the NAFTA? I don't know how expereinced Kushner is, however, seeing how the U.S. is more akin to a giant company than a normal country, he might prove useful. I honestly find the idea of the need for the president to give up his business, and thus for a blind trust to be ridiculous. If you don't trust a man to be able to set his private interests aside in managing the country, why would you elect him to be president in the first place?

Right-wingers ("right-winger" meaning someone that disagrees with the leftist political elite in the slightest) have been getting purposefully mischaracterised and slandered as racists, sexists, xenophobes, misogynists, fascists and god knows what else by the left-leaning elite and media for years, and a good number of citizens joined in themselves. Look at that guy above, the one that implicitly called me a genocidal imbecile based on nothing but my political views (which he's utterly uneducated on, along with everything else that isn't 'Murica), then finished it off by saying that he isn't even interested in my counter-arguments or clarification. Can't really blame people for getting a bit irate, and going off with the insults after years of that. Similarly, I don't blame some of the lefties who think that we just respond with an endless permutation of cuck, shill, beta and libtard, as some people will actually do that, either because they're actually trolls, or because they themselves got fed up with the insults from the other side. Anyway, I hope that things will be normalised in the coming years, and I'm always glad to talk. First off, I'm not under the impression that Trump will make a generally good president. I'm under the impression that he'll be around average, slightly above average at best. He's infinitely better than Clinton would have been, but that is not Trump's virtue, but Clinton's fault. I'm hopeful when it comes to his foreign policy, he'll probably be a net positive for the U.S. economy, and he'll hopefully shake things up a bit internally, so that the next president can actually come along and start fixing things. Clinton, along with a descent into war and an oligarchy, would have brought along political stagnation, and the death of the republic in the long term. Meanwhile, Trump at least offers the possiblity of change. My main point is thread has been that: 1. He has done nothing that would necessitate him literally being stripped of his humanity. 2. He's not the baby-killing incarnation of the combined malice of every fascist dictator that ever lived. 3. He's not guilty of the things he's being accused of. Want to attack him on climate change? That's totally legit, go ahead. But calling him a racist and a xenophobe, a hatemongering demagogue, saying that he managed to "reverse years of civil rights accomplishments"? That's baseless slander at best, pure lunacy at worst. People should stop with the unfounded ad hominems and hyperbole, this is politics, not a saturday morning cartoon where Trump is the big bad. Is there a problem with the border wall project? I haven't been informed of any serious setbacks. What did you mean by that? I agree that his efforts so far have been lackluster with the whole "swamp-draining" thing. However: Trump still needs the backing of congress, and the Graham-McCain faction of the GOP has been consistently hostile towards him. He might be advancing in baby steps because he doesn't want to piss off his own party. When it comes to the people he appointed, there is difference between corruption and corruption. I, of course, prefer no corruption at all, but that is near impossible in a republic. However, there is a difference between someone that makes a bit of profit on the sidelines while doing his job for the nation, and someone that uses the state as a tool to explicitly further his own gains and ventures, potentially against the nation's interests. Clinton's clique betrayed U.S. state interests by getting in bed with the houses of Thani and Saud, while I haven't seen anything nearly as harmful and dangerous on Trump's side. If you look at the polls Politifact cited, you'll see that they're purposefully weaving their narrative into their statement. Yes, "many" Americans are interested in his tax returns. That being the overwhelming majority of Democrats, and a minority of Republicans. "Many Americans" implies a demand all across the nation, regardless of politics and class, not that this is a partisan issue. It is technically not a lie, just a subtle manipulation of the interpretation of the facts. It would also have been relevant to add a statistic about how important people think this issue is. Say, ranking it against an investigation against Hillary Clinton, or something like that. If the people "want" it, but rank it at the bottom of priorities, then Trump's statement that they "don't care" holds merit. In retrospect, seeing how he won the election, it must not have been that important. For example, our Socialist government between 2006 and 2010 royally screwed up the country (and I do mean royally, political violence started to appear, there was an extremely popular de facto militia marching around the country in formation and uniforms, the whole thing damn near resulted in a revolution), but all of their media outlets kept banging on about how great we were doing, because they built a lot of bike paths. Now, I want more bike paths to be built in my country, who doesn't love bike paths? If someone presents me with a survey if I'd like more bike paths, I'll say sure, why not. However, I'm more interested in fixing up our healthcare, education, law enforcement, and holding corrupt politicians accountable. So, if somebody says that I don't care about bike paths, he's right in that it is the issue I care about the least. Normally, I'm also more in favour of answering the arguments of media outlets. However: Not when it's this ridiculous. If they accuse you of being a bad politician, sure, argue with them. If they call you a fascist, a racist, a xenophobe, and essentially label you the harbinger of apocalypse, a more dismissive and stern answer is appropriate. I don't think Trump has the patience to go into the media's little game of trading jabs, and it's not really fit for the public persona he built either. It's different audiences. Obama was mainly focusing on the middle class. On the other hand, Trump is focusing on the lower class. The lower class tends to care more about the appearance of power, than about witty comebacks, at least around here. Trump isn't the laughing stock of "the world", as I said, people around here aren't too distasteful towards him, certainly less distasteful than towards Clinton. Honestly, what people laught at is stuff like CNN covering how many scoops of ice cream Trump eats, or Maddow's ridiculous Spiel before revealing that there is nothing incriminating in Trump's tax returns. His more "explicit" reactions towards media outlets also haven't garnered much revulsion, mainly because most people don't pay attention to U.S. politics that closely (seriously, him calling CNN "fake news" from the podium is obviously something that got covered, but we have our own countries, not everybody is busy watching Trump's Twitter feed), and the ones that do see them as strikes against a snobbish media disconnected from the population, whose interests it is supposed to serve. CNN has lost quite a lot of its prestige with this last campaign of misinformation and slander, and people aren't going to be pissed at someone that tells them off. Also, didn't Obama straight-up throw Fox News out of the White House? I don't think he's unable to take scrutiny. Every time someone meets him in person behind closed doors, they say he leaves a good impression, is productive in talks, and is generally a good partner in negotiations. As far as I can tell, his public outbursts seem to be planned, and they serve a purpose, something akin to an extension of Nixon's "Madman theory". We live in a new age, social media will undoubtedly take a part in politics from now on. Trump's Twitter spats may not be the most cultured way of going about that, but they certainly beat the crap out of every other U.S. politician. There was a time when politicians found it inappropriate to talk to newspapers and appear on TV, are we seriously going to play the same silly game with Twitter, until it gets accepted and normalised in a decade's time? I'm not that familiar with Trump's activity before the presidency (believe it or not, barely anybody heard about him around here before the campaign, I only did so because I've been paying attention to American politics for about a decade now, but I didn't really pay close attention to him), I don't feel sufficiently equipped to discuss his life before the campaign. Trickle-down economics depend very much on the culture, and especially on the political culture of the elite. After the land reform, the clergy and nobles in my country didn't spend their money on bringing in cheap workforce from Romania, or exploiting and effectively re-enserfing the peasantry, but on mdoernising their estates and developing the localities. You'd have a hard time finding a school that wasn't founded by a bishop or a noble, they knew they'd eventually benefit from an educated and wealthy workforce too, and that if they offered better wages, people would work harder, and that they'd attract workers from others who paid less. It is not an unreasonable concept, and neither is it unreasonable to say that Trump actually believes in it.

Normally I wouldn't bother typing this in a youtube comment section as the only reply I will get is cuck, libtard, snowflake, fake news believing, beta male but you present yourself as someone smart and reasonable. He consistently lies and is a hypocrite. I understand your viewpoint of lying being ok and I agree with that...only if it is to benefit the nation. His campaign promised many things, most productive first 100days (an unofficial US custom), a wall on the southern border (paid for by Mexico), and "draining the swamp" (getting rid of Washington insiders and big corporations out of politics). He further exacerbated the "swamp" problem by filling most of the position with big money interests and personal interests. Now I understand he can be "grandstanding" on some issues but if he was a smart man he would realise that lying is a weapon that gets duller with each use. He is not using his weapons rightly and while not being taken seriously can be used as a weapon in itself, there are much more demerits than merits when it comes to being a world leader (especially on the negotiation table). Also I believe politifacts.com to be a great site, if you look at the "lies" you need to click on the link as well, it shows their reasoning behind why they think it's a lie and provides the evidence for their ruling. You asked for numbers and if you clicked on the links you'd see the 5-6 polls they based their "many americans" statement on. Any man would get pissed when getting painted as such by the media, agreed but a better man wouldn't be childish and call every news outlet "fake news" except for the ones that agree with him (fox, rush, etc). A better man would instead prove them wrong by making good decisions, using a more expansive vocabulary, or basically not make himself a laughing stock of the world (atleast remember which country you bombed). Obama for instance made witty comebacks and humorous jabs, while seeming to sound well educated. His inability to take scrutiny is a big deal as it shows he has a temperamental attitude. This is a terrible attribute to have on a leader, especially a world leader, unless he has the ability to compose himself (which he clearly doesn't). It doesn't show maturity when you're having a twitter wars So then what about his human compassion? Does he have a sense of justice or morality that drives him to better the living conditions of his fellow countrymen? Well examples has shown us...no, he makes a charity and uses donation money to buy a portrait, signed helmet, settle his lawsuits, etc. How about trump university? Aggressively sell hopeful young adults a dream only to realise that it was all a hoax. Of course he loves trickle down economics because it favours the rich, the IMF shows that TDE is a joke and it should be intuitively obvious(only increasing the wealth inequality gap). How about the environment? His head of environment protection agency is a climate change denier who pockets money from oil company and the head of enegery is rick perry. Yes China, India, etc also has a huge detrimental effect on the environment but they acknowledged the issue and are meeting the carbon reduction set out for them as agreed. But atleast he is a strongman who forges straight away right? Except he keeps changing his stance on abortion, nafta, nato, EU, etc etc. His stance seems to change depending on who he meets or how the public views him. So we have this man who is favored due to his business acumen, even though he accrued alot of debt and inherited his initial funds. He puts his son in law and daughter in important positions (although they have no prior experience in politics) and has his other son manage his assets as a blind trust (which is not how a blind trust works). Again I see no reason to believe he will do a good job as the president	UCGim0YCp9N7InBsQA49hbJw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGim0YCp9N7InBsQA49hbJw	1	Uggo72NsVox--ngCoAEC	SkyHigh5280

Every climatologist I talked to said that we're over the tipping point, we can slow things down, but Earth is essentially beyond saving (at least with the current size of the population, especially in Africa and SE Asia), however, I'd very much prefer to keep this rock livable until we can get off it. Though I'm not intimately familiar with it, from what I've seen the EPA strikes me as a cumbersome, bureaucratic, and ultimately useless organ, however - if that is indeed the case - it should be fixed up, not dismantled. All that said, that is still not ground enough to dehumanise Trump, and as you pointed out, this issue isn't even dominant in Trump's opposition. Also, while I wouldn't like to see American pollution levels increasing, most of the current pollution is coming from the third world and China. Trump's pressure on the Chinese economy will hopefully cause them to start modernising to some degree (China is also under huge pressure from the inside, they can barely pay their army, they're implementing increasingly draconian measures to crush any political dissent, and poverty in their cities is staggering, they'll either go that route within the next couple of years, or collapse), and, if he does end the U.S.-Saudi co-operation, I can only hope that we, in Europe, will do the same thing, and become resource-independent. Also, Trump's more active competition with China might bring him to match the Chinese efforts in Djibouti and Senegal by starting to subsidise African countries on his own (Nigeria would be a big one to get on the American side), and if we built a system of proper irrigation throughout Africa instead of the chaotic and useless methods they're using currently, global warming wouldn't be threatening such a humanitarian catastrophe. Global warming, at least in the short-mid-term, would be a net benefit for a significant portion of the Western world, a large part of Canada and Russia would become more habitable and fit for agriculture, the problem comes from places like Bangladesh, which would essentially get flooded, and, well... most of Africa, where the population would go starving as deserts, and regions unfit for agriculture expanded. Improving the economy of these regions would soften the blow of global warming, and Trump might do just that. If you look at the issue as a whole, he might even be a net positive, but your point is legitimate, and the gutting of the EPA, along with the greater freedom corporations are being granted are worrying. But to reiterate, I'm absolutely fine with a civilised political opposition to Trump, but this doesn't give grounds to anyone to strip him of his humanity.

I'd rather push all the rhetoric, racism, sexism, and xenophobia aside to talk about one main key, all of us, human beings, should be aware and scared of. The deregulation of corporate companies in the US. As far as other countries having the "same" regulations as us is absurd and inaccurate. The United States leads by example and does not follow in the same foot steps of other countries particularly environmental friendly methods. I'm appalled by a lot of things with Trump's administration but the dismantling of the EPA had me quite livid. There's no excuse for allowing coal companies to throw debris into local rivers. There's no excuse for Trump to deny climate change. I'm not quite understanding how this topic is not being brought up...

What the actual fuck! How is that okay!!!" So he's got a disgusting sense of humour. "How about where he told a female reporter right to her face that she wouldn't have her job if she wasn't beautiful." Was it true? "How about the mans inability to take scrutiny? A president needs to be able to handle scrutiny. This guy handles it worse than some of the third graders I teach." I actually don't mind that he isn't afraid to talk back to overly smug and preachy media outlets. "President Bush was called the village idiot and other horrible things for years, the man kept his composure. Barack Obama was called the anti-christ..." Trump has been called a racist, a misogynist, a nazi, ignorant, stupid, and many other things, not by rednecks living in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, but by trusted and well-established media outlets. That's more than enough to get pissed. A man who wouldn't retort after that isn't someone that can handle scrutiny, he's weak and a coward. I'm not particularly fond of Trump's style, but I don't see a problem with his mentality. The shit they hurled at him would have warranted a challenge to duel a hundred years ago, Twitter spats are the mildest possible response to something like that. "After being told he mocked the disabled reporter and there is video evidence of him doing it he shouted "WRONNGGG." He was mocking him, however, he wasn't mocking him for being disabled. That's the exact same expression Trump used when he was mocking Ted Cruz, it's how he characterises incompetent and indecisive people. Also, what, you can't mock disabled people? I mean mocking someone for their disability is a dick move (though he wasn't doing that), don't get me wrong, but you can't mock them at all? Do you have any idea how condescending that is? Several of my family members, my dad amongst them, are disabled, and let me tell you, they wouldn't appreciate being treated like pampered little children, that need to be protected from the mildest insults and disagreements. "You know what, thats the biggest difference between him and Clinton." I'd say the biggest difference is that Clinton's policy would have put the U.S. on a collision course with Russia. I - as someone that wouldn't get to sit the war out while stuffing my face with cheeseburgers, but as someone whose country would be the second in line to be skewered by Russian spearheads, and who would probably end up dying in the initial offensive of the war - care a bit more about that, than about Trump insulting random media personalities. If you think that Trump telling some random media guy to sod off is worse than that, you shouldn't be voting. "...didn't know anything about the North Korean Regimes leaders for the past 30 years until like two days ago..." Got any proof for that? I'd be interested in reading it. "...didn't know what the nuclear triangle is." Triad. Not triangle, triad. Also, I highly doubt that Carter was educated on how a Soviet army would carry out a standard deep battle offensive, as long as he has his advisors, he doesn't have to be a competent general. Also, I doubt that he doesn't know what the nuclear triad is, he might have not been familiar with the technical term. I wasn't familiar with it, thought that's probably because English isn't my first language. "He is a rich pampered business boy who has lived in luxury his ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE! Does a rich pampered person know how to handle something as stressful as the POTUS." If you think being a businessman is easy and non-stressful, I'm sorry, but you have absolutely no fucking clue about how big business is run. A man of that caliber probably works 70-80 hour work weeks, and gets a day or two off every month. "Nah. He's gonna leave that to his aides while he plays golf and watches TV." If you think that he is that unqualified, isn't that a good thing? "He is a business man. He is built to bullshit people. To be a scheister. To say "everything will be great." To get his way." First off, shyster or Scheißer. Not scheister. Secondly, again, that's not how business works. "Then consider how he praises leaders who slaughter thousands of innocent people, then calls someone like Barack Obama "sick and bad." Who are exactly these men he praised? Care to give examples? Also, why are you acting like those are two separate categories? To my knowledge, Obama waged covert bombing campaigns and proxy wars in more countries than anyone before him, and he wasn't afraid at all to target civillian gatherings. Obama's death count is probably higher than Assad's. "Man I wish I could punch him right in his stupid FUCKING FACE TO GET HIM TO ADMIT ALL THE SHIT HES EVER DONE WRONG! DONALD TRUMP, SAY SORRY YOU STUPID FUCK. SAY. FUCKING. SORRY!" So let's get this straight: You don't like his sense of humour. You don't like that he insulted a riporter. You don't like that he shoots back at media outlets that have taken shots at him. You think he's unqualified, which I disagree with. So you want to punch him in the face? Ah, mate, you really do belong into civil society. "Thank you james193945 for not being backass, haughty, and ignorant, like modern day authoritarians are..." I wrote a multi-paragraph comment, where I stayed civil, and properly explained my points. In return, you said: "He's gonna be shitting his diapers soon while watching Fox and Friends waiting to get a boner when they say nice things about him. God save us all. Man I wish I could punch him right in his stupid FUCKING FACE TO GET HIM TO ADMIT ALL THE SHIT HES EVER DONE WRONG! DONALD TRUMP, SAY SORRY YOU STUPID FUCK. SAY. FUCKING. SORRY!"

"I'd only add that this approach to government has a lot to do with how much of a shithole most authoritarian countries are." I can think of 3 authoritarian countries in the civilised world. Russia, China, and Belarus. Now here's a little hint, the state of living conditions in those countries might have just a little bit to do with the fact that they were all plagued by stalinism for decades, and by decades more of state socialism afterwards. And if democracy indeed makes living conditions better instantly, tell me, why is it that living conditions have been on the decline in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia and Poland, all of which turned into democracies after the collpase of the USSR and Yugoslavia, while they've been on the rise in authoritarian Russia? If you're talking third world, sure, let's talk about that. How good are living conditions in democratic Nigeria, compared to Iran? Or when was Libya doing better? Under the authoritarian rule of Gaddafi, or now, that they've been "liberated"? Wanna talk about historical examples, when right-wing authoritarianism and democracy co-existed in the civilised world? Germany alone had the military and economical power to wrestle the combined might of Britain, France and the United States, Stolypin transformed the Russian society of illiterate serfs into relatively well-off peasants, and his policies would have continued to create a stable agrarian middle class, had they been not interrupted by the war, regent Horthy brought Hungary into a golden age, and I don't think I need to sing odes about the achievements of emperor Meiji in Japan. Tell me, do you know anything about how an authoritarian system works? Are you aware of... well, any history that isn't about the U.S.? "Unless they follow the 'bread and circuses' route, which will buy stability for a while, then crash spectacularly." The irony of that statement is indescribable. First off, "panem et circenses" was an expression used to describe a policy established in the Roman republican era, around 150 BC. This policy basically consisted of distributing cheap grain, and holding games to appease the plebs of the city, before major votes and political events. The policy was originally implemented by the optimates, who needed the spontaneous support of the city's masses for their self-serving military expeditions and legislations. The "panem et circenses" policy was established as a tool of the republic, and is simply not needed in an authoritarian state, as obviously an authoritarian ruler doesn't need to win the votes of the public. What sort of mental gymnastics you performed to come to the conclusion that an authoritarian would somehow need to win the votes of the poor is beyond me. The policy however was turned on its head by the populares, who used it to rally support against the very optimates who implemented this system. Only difference is, after the populares came out on top, and created the Empire, unlike the optimates, who were solely concerned with expanding their own latifundia, they actually took steps to improve living conditions in the city of Rome. Thus, the policy became less and less necessary during the 1st century, became largely unnecessary by the end of the 2nd, and when emperor Septimius Severus expanded the citizenship to most residents of the provinciae in 212, it simply wasn't needed anymore, as the masses of Rome could no longer single-handedly sway policy decisions. The "panem et circenses" policy was implemented by the republic, and for the republic. I don't know how you managed to tie it to authoritarians. If you look at more modern examples, that is clearly not the case. Bismarck transformed the disjointed German states into Europe's strongest power, Meiji achieved 500 years of economical and social progress in 50, Witte and Stolypin modernised Europe's largest and most backwards country within decades, and Horthy brought my country out of the crises and chaos of the 1920s. All these people were concerned with permanently improving their countries and the living conditions in them, and all of them attempted, and to some degree succeeded to create a middle class as the state's backbone. Because, spoiler alert, if you're a democratic leader, you can get to power, you can take out loans against the nation's interests so you can avoid making uncomfortable policy decisions, you can have your bread and circuses, and, after 4 years, you can sod off to your private villa, and live off your offshore accounts. If you're an authoritarian, leadership is for life, you don't get to pass on your problems to the next in line, and if you trade the long-term interests of the nation for short-term personal gains, you'll be getting the rope in the end.

Are you actually interested in why my country has become such a "basket case"? As I said in my last comment, we had a monarchy and an aristocracy until the 1940s, which were extremely effective at running the country. At the time, the head of state was regent Horthy, due to the restoration of the Habsburgs being forbidden in the treaties of Trianon and Saint-Germain, and several factions disagreeing about how the new king would be elected. In 1940, the Germans came knocking on our door, essentially saying that it's time to pick a side, and if we don't join their invasion of Yugoslavia, they'll attack us. Our government asked for time to think about it, and contacted the British Foreign Office, asking what sort of British assistance us and the Yugoslavs can expect against Germany, and what sort of terms we'd get in the eventual peace treaty. The British answer was brief and simple: Hold out on your own, you get no assistance, and we'll be the ones that decide in the peace treaty. So, instead of throwing the lives of our citizens away in a hopeless war against the German goliath, our leaders decided to join the invasion of Yugoslavia. When this decision was made, our prime minister, count Teleki, committed suicide, writing in his letter to regent Horthy that he'll not obstruct our course of action, but he will not become an oath-breaker (we signed a treaty of "eternal friendship" with Yugoslavia earlier). Churchil commented that an empty seat would be reserved for Teleki at the negotiations, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Despite entering the war on Germany's side, our government didn't break connections with the Western allies, and, in 1943, prime minister Kállay entered secret negotiations with the Americans about us switching sides, and joining the fight against Germany. He didn't make contact with the Soviets at the behest of Western allies. By the end of the year, Kállay had worked out a deal with the Western allies that would have preserved our sovereignty, and left us a chance to negotiate about territory. The Germans, feeling that something was off, occupied our country in the march of 1944, despite us being allies. In the Autumn of 1944, despite the German presence, our government attempted to honour the deal anyway. Horthy told our troops to stop fighting the approaching Soviet forces, pockets of resistance against the Germans were formed all across the country, and several high-ranking officers defected to the Soviets, who then led units formed by Hungarian POW's against the Germans. Of course, Germany wasn't too happy about that, the regent was deposed (they forced him to abdicate by kidnapping his son and threatening his life), prime minister Kállay was arrested and sent to a concetration camp, and the fascist puppet set up by Germany instituted a reign of terror. By 1945, it became obvious that the Western allies didn't intend to honour the deal. Soviet troops didn't leave the country, they set up their own military administration, and a purge of our political elite was carried out, nobles were rounded up and executed, or sent to the Gulag. Despite that, in the - for now - democratic elections, we made the right choice, with the Party of Small Landowners, one of the democratic opposition parties during the Horthy-era, scoring a landslide victory. By 1947, however, it became obvious that this wouldn't stand. The peace treaties set the perpetual Soviet presence in stone, and, in 1947, Stalin decided to pull the leash tighter. In 1947 and 1948, the remnants of our political elite were destroyed, Horthy's democratic opposition parties, along with the prime minister and president at the time, were all branded traitors and class-enemies, they were all executed, or sent to the Gulag, with the few lucky ones fleeing to the United States. They, of course, appealed for help, and didn't receive any. Thus, we were left with no political elite, aside from the communists. From 1948 to the 1950s, our country was ruled by a Stalinist puppet, Rákosi. From 1949 onwards, he decided to continue the political purges, and started something reminiscent of Stalin's "Great Purge", going after his own party members. In 1949, one of the two major factions of the Worker's Party, the so-called "home communists" (in the 1930s, the communist party was made illegal in the country, which split it into two factions, the so-called "home communists", who stayed in Hungary, functioning from illegality, and the so-called "Muscovites", who fled the country, and resided in Moscow during the war) was entirely purged, with its de facto leader, Rajk, being executed after a show trial. In the 1950s, Stalin's death sent a shockwave through the Eastern Bloc, which could also be felt here. Dissatisfaction with the regime peaked, Rákosi was called back to Moscow, but that wasn't nearly enough. Egged on by American propaganda promising help, our country went into open revolution in 1956, members of the secret police were lynched by the crowd. The reformist elements of the Workers Party, led by minister of agriculture Nagy Imre, decided that instead of fighting the revolution, they would lead it, and transform Hungary into a truly democratic state. Free elections were declared, political prisoners were freed, the oppresive apparatus of the communist regime was dismantled. However, instead of receiving the promised Western help, the United States actively gave the green light to the Soviets, proclaiming that they didn't view Hungary and Poland (similar events were going on there) as "potential allies". Within days, a Soviet armoured collumn broke through the country's borders. Of course, our government did put up a fight, but college students with 20-year-old AT guns won't stop a collumn of state of the art Soviet tanks. The revolution was bloodily crushed, all elements of the army siding with it were eliminated, and the reformists of the Workers Party were all executed, or sent to the gulag. Thus, the only person somewhat versed in politics was appointed to run the country. That person was Kádár, a former reformist, who backstabbed the revolution during the Soviet intervention. While there's a lot of blood on his hands, I get the feeling he accepted the position with a "if not me, someone else is going to" mentality, as he later obstructed Soviet attempts at direct interference within the country, and actually gave a crap about the people. Kádár essentially became inseparable from the system, however, he became incapable of actually leading the country by the 1980s, and died in 1989. This left the Workers Party in total disarray, seeing how their system was dependent on the personality of Kádár. In 1989, the Soviet Union fell, and our political right-wing party at the time, which was rural/agrarian and nationalist in nature, proposed a "hard" regime change, that the remnants of the communist rule and the Workers Party be rooted out totally. However, we came under immense international pressure to respect the "human rights" of agents of the secret police who spent the better part of their life unjustly torturing and murdering their political opposition, so, the left-wing of that party backstabbed its own right-wing, and made a deal with the much more moderate liberal party. Thus, no retribution against the former communists was carried out, with the entrenched positions they gained during the Soviet rule, they came out on top during the privatisation of the 1990s, and run most of the country to this day. That is how we ended up here, with no established political culture, and with no political elite, aside from the corrupt oligarchic leftovers of the communist era. So yeah, we're trying to improve our system, as we were in the past, but I hope there will be nobody idiotic enough in this country to seek Western assistance to improve our conditions. My current primary concern is getting a leader who won't embezzle so much money that a hundred of my fellow countrymen end up freezing to death in their own homes during the Winter due to not being able to afford heating, but getting them to stop lying will come straight after that.

Mate, you have no bloody clue how ridiculous things are over here. Our government recently launched a propaganda campaign costing hundreds of millions of HUF (a couple million USD), which literally tells us that our country is great. That's the whole message. A couple years ago, they had a campaign by the name of "Come home, young man!" which cost us about a hundred million HUF (about 400k USD), with the goal of bringing some of our 200 thousand emmigrants home. They managed to get a grand total of 105 of them (105 people, not thousands) to return, after which they announced the programme to be a success. I don't give a crap about simple, rethorical lies, as long as there is no money involved. Also, I see you missed one of the more important parts of my comment. Does anyone actually believe the stuff that comes out of his mouth? Again, when a politician holds a speech around here, it's simply assumed that he's lying, so it doesn't really matter. "...to a nationalistic, racist, anti-intellectual base." I don't see the problem with nationalism (you are a nation-state, for Christ's sake), I have seen no indication of them being racists, and while anti-intellectualism is harmful and should be avoided, I can honestly understand the sentiment with how bad American academics have gotten. Your engineers are totally fine, mind you, but the humanities might be beyond saving at this point, unless you guys tear the whole thing down. Have you actually read what ou linked me? I won't even bother with Salon, but let's look at the politifact thingy: "No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days." - FDR and others did more How? What is the measure of "how much they did"? This was an empty statement on Trump's part, and Politifact's rebuttal is just as empty. "While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!" - Sanders was mocking Trump How does that make it false? They could have just as easily said "He likes the taste of pickled herring." That is totally irrelevant to Trump's statement, and doesn't make it false. "Americans don't "care at all" about Donald Trump's tax returns." - Polls show many Americans want to see them How much is "many"? Actually including a statistic instead of weasel words might be a good idea. And I didn't even go through the whole page, I just scrolled down and stopped and 3 random points. And I'm not saying that Trump doesn't make blatantly false statements. But that list is ridiculous, and obviously partisan. If you want to nail Trump for lying, get him when he lies demonstrably, and when he is actually lying. "It’s not smearing or slander if they are just reporting what he does." I meant the stuff going on during the election, the constant smearing of Trump as a racist, and media personalities crying upon his election, as if he was the antichrist himself, or something. "You should expect better from your leaders." Yeah, you can expect a lot of things. Won't make them come true though. Tell me, how should I put pressure on my leaders? Who should I vote for? Should I vote for the current governing party, which won two thirds of the seats in the 2014 election by skewing the electoral law in its own favour, and only getting about 40% of the vote, and which is also responsible for the miserable state my country is in? Should I vote for the Socialists, who are remnants of the old communist party, and who screwed up the country so much during their governing between 2002 and 2010, that they allowed our current ruling party to win a landslide victory? Should I vote for the Liberals, who were cronies and coalition partners of the Socialists, and who currently control a grand total of 1 seat of in the Parliament out of 200? Or should I vote for the radical Christian nationalists, who'll probably get us thrown out of the EU, and declare war on Romania?

Well, just in case it's the latter, and you decide to read it anyway: "I'm sure things are seen as different in Hungary where first fascist and then communist authoritarianism was the norm for decades..." Fascism was never the norm in Hungary. We had a fascist government for a grand total of 5 months, between the Germans occupying the country and deposing the legitimate government, and the Soviets pushing the Germans out and occupying us themselves. It's also hardly fair to call communist rule the "norm". While they were around for 44 years, the regime was widely hated by the general population, we had a violent revolution against them in the '50s, and they were only propped up by the occupying Soviet forces. "...fascist and then communist authoritarianism..." Both fascism and communism are totalitarian in nature, not authoritarian. "...but in America and many other western nations we have a concept called "consent of the governed" which means that..." I'm not sure if you're being condescending on purpose, or if you actually think that I'm this uneducated. Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. However, one, I believe that the interests of the governed trump the will of the governed. Two, a state which has the consent of the governed will function infinitely better, however, that doesn't mean the country needs to be constantly micro-managed by votes. A parliament fractured into many parties will obstruct the executive branch's work, national interests will become partisan issues and sacrificed for electoral victories, and foreign policy will become as inconsistent and fickle as the public opinion. There's more way than one to seek the approval of the citizens. Or would you say that Napoleon III - who abolished the republic and declared himself emperor through a referendum, which had a turnout of about 80%, and went 97% in his favour - didn't have the consent of the governed? I'm also not opposed to democracy on a local level, however, matters of state interest, the budget, the military, and foreign policy should be handled by an executive body that doesn't get switched out every 4 years, and is possibly assisted by a consultative national assembly. "...political power isn't simply based on whoever can muster the most stormtroopers to further their views." You have no bloody clue about how a monarchy functions, do you? Have you even heard about elective monarchy? "That kind of thinking has led to the deaths of uncountable millions of people in countries all over the world." Yeah, that would be the fascists and the commies. The proportion of casualties during the Holocaust were the lowest in my country in Central Europe. You know why? Because the government and the aristocrats found even the concept that the government would turn on its own citizens to be abhorrent, therefore all German plans were sabotaged where they could, and the Germans only managed to kick off the extermination after they occupied our country. "With that in mind, try to think about why it might be seen as a little childishly stupid for you to come in and say that what Trump is doing must be okay by definition because he's the leader of the country." That is indeed childishly stupid. I also didn't say anything along those lines. I honestly have absolutely no clue what you're talking about, and which one of my points you managed to misconstrue in such a way, so I can't even respond to this. "Your archaic and frankly tragically sad ideas aren't worth debating with." I just love that you have all my ideas figured out, all based on the word "authoritarian". Anyways, those are some nice buzzwords you got there, buddy! Let's pick them apart, shall we? "archaic" Your country has a constitution that's over 200 years old, and, if you want to talk about where their basis came from, they go back all the way to the founding of the Roman Republic. On the other hand, my "ideas" were only nearly realised during Stolypin's transformation of Russia into a constitutional autocracy with a strong, agrarian middle class in the early 1900s. Your ideas are dionsaurs compared to mine. However, just because a concept is old, it doesn't become automatically bad. "tragically sad" Under these "tragically sad" ideas my country entered a golden age from the 1860s onwards up until the world war, when our economy and living standards were nearly on a constant rise. Again, from the late 1920s onward, my "tragically sad" ideas proved effective in combating the global economic crisis, our system of education became one of the best in the world (which is why we provided the world with many top physicians and informaticians), living standards were again on the rise, and the peasant question started to be handled effectively. It was these same "tragically sad" ideas which transformed Russia from a serf-holding illiterate medieval shithole to a modern great power on par with Britain, and which transformed Germany into the powerhouse that alone wrestled France, the UK and the U.S., and only lost in the coin toss of the Kaiserschlacht. Meanwhile, your enlightened democracy has utterly ruined my country, along with everyone else east of the Oder (and to some degree even Germany) in the last 30 years, former communist leaders were never gotten rid of (because you apparently can't do that in a democracy), and our system is corrupt beyond belief. Tell me, do you actually think that democracy is a system that can be just exported and applied anywhere you go? Do you need a reminder of what happened when you guys decided to bring freedom and democracy to Iraq? "Don't bother responding, as I won't read it." That's the sort of opennes to ideas I've come to expect from Americans lately. I'm always happy to be surprised though.

You didn't really have to go any further than "I'm an authoritarian and I don't believe in democracy" You should have opened with that to let Americans know they didn't have to waste time reading your comments. I'm sure things are seen as different in Hungary where first fascist and then communist authoritarianism was the norm for decades, but in America and many other western nations we have a concept called "consent of the governed" which means that political power isn't simply based on whoever can muster the most stormtroopers to further their views. That kind of thinking has led to the deaths of uncountable millions of people in countries all over the world. In America, we have a republic, and we have for centuries. So when a political ruling class comes in that distorts or attempts to distort the type of government we've had since the founding of the nation, you might expect many of our citizens to get a little hot under the collar over it. With that in mind, try to think about why it might be seen as a little childishly stupid for you to come in and say that what Trump is doing must be okay by definition because he's the leader of the country. Unlike Lee, I won't waste my time debating with someone who's stated they're okay with leaders lying to their people and that the will of the people is irrelevant in terms of what the government is doing, as that is the definition of authoritarianism.

He isn't an ethical human being by the most basic standards. Did you watch the clip where he said "sex" is the thing he has in common with Ivanka? His own daughter? What the actual fuck! How is that okay!!! How about where he told a female reporter right to her face that she wouldn't have her job if she wasn't beautiful. How about the mans inability to take scrutiny? A president needs to be able to handle scrutiny. This guy handles it worse than some of the third graders I teach. President Bush was called the village idiot and other horrible things for years, the man kept his composure. Barack Obama was called the anti-christ and accused of all these outrageous conspiracy theory bullshit (WHICH, LOOK NOW YOU STUPID FUCKING CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, NONE OF THE SHIT YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT CAME TRUE, GET A FUCKING GRIP!!!!!) Yet Obama maintained his composure and dignity. Trump receives a criticism and goes guns blazing, like a CHILD. Then that brings me to this point. The man cannot say sorry OR admit when he is wrong. Like the disabled reporter thing. After being told he mocked the disabled reporter and there is video evidence of him doing it he shouted "WRONNGGG." At that point its just like, come on Don, at least be a human being and say sorry I made a mistake. How the fuck can you lead a country and not be able to own up to when you mess up? You know what, thats the biggest difference between him and Clinton. Clinton at least apologized to us America, we are fucking idiots for not realizing this HUGE difference between both of them. He constantly posts unfounded things, didn't know anything about the North Korean Regimes leaders for the past 30 years until like two days ago, didn't know what the nuclear triangle is. He is so unqualified its fucking pathetic. He is a rich pampered business boy who has lived in luxury his ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE! Does a rich pampered person know how to handle something as stressful as the POTUS. Nah. He's gonna leave that to his aides while he plays golf and watches TV. He is a business man. He is built to bullshit people. To be a scheister. To say "everything will be great." To get his way. Then consider how he praises leaders who slaughter thousands of innocent people, then calls someone like Barack Obama "sick and bad." I'm sorry Raccoon. But the evidence is all here man. The guy has made the office a joke. The guy is a fat swine senile 70 year old man who never should have been elected.

Just make sure to check if it fits the official narrative in your country. I don't know how it is where you're from, but around here, relying on the official textbooks is more important than talking about what actually happened and why - at least when it comes to exams - and the textbooks tend to be 3-5 decades behind historical research, and are usually tainted by politics. I know a prof. who has done some groundbreaking historical work, roughly 40 years ago. Recently, when I said something about the subject, he replied with "Oh, I see my work is finally starting to drip into the university curriculum. GIve it 20 more, and they might learn about it in high school." Another good example would be our textbooks on Imperial Russia, which echo the baseless narrative crafted by the Soviets in the 1960s-1970s. I don't know how the system works where you're from, but if it's anything like it is over here, make sure to check if what I said fits with the official line.

You have celebrities calling for a violent revolution, - in the case of Sarah Silverman, calling for the army to commit an act of high treason, depose the lawfully elected government, and establish a military junta - you have people publicly complaining that Jimmy Fallon having Trump on his show "humanises a monster" and "normalises hate", and you had "assassinatetrump" trending as a hashtag on Twitter. These are outright calls to violent action - and I'm not sure if those are even legal in th U.S. - and complaints that he is even being portrayed as a human being. On top of that, you have this show photoshopping him like he's naked, people joking about him and his daughter committing incest, and statements attacking his 9-year-old son. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for a bit of harmless fun, and I'll be the first one to make a joke about what indecent acts our speaker of the national assembly must have committed with the prime minister to get his position, but seriously, complaining that the president (presidential candidate at the time) is portrayed like he is a human being, calling for his death, and going after his family? That's going way overboard. Yes, the line between what is acceptable and what isn't sure is cloudy, but it's clear what side these people are falling on. The French Revolution was indeed mainly carried out by the proletariat, however, it was not targeted at, but led by the burgeoisie. Even though I disagree with the vast majority of his views, Marx's characterisation of the events - the burgeoisie exploiting the dissatisfaction of the proletariat, so that they (the middle class) could trade places with the aristocrats (the upper class) by capitalising on the girevances of the lower class, who only trade masters in the process, but don't improve their own miserable conditions in the slightest - was relatively accurate, if a bit oversimplified and ideologically driven. In reality, that was further complicated by differences in lifestyle, and a huge fault line in society. The "agrarian proletariat" envisioned by the SR's and the Bolsheviks didn't exist back then, farmers and city workers weren't even connected to the small degree they are nowadays. The village and the city were essentially paralell societies due to this separation and the rights and autonomy granted to cities by earlier kings. The burgeoisie, using the city's proletariat masses (not the best term to describe them, but I don't know of a better one in English) attempted to wrestle control from the aristocrats, who were - at least originally - mainly rural in nature, exploiting their politically advantegous position of residing in the capital, and of their population being much more concentrated than that of the peasants and aristocrats, even though they made up only a relatively small minority of the population of the country as a whole. I'd argue that the French Revolution was at least as much of a rural-urban conflict as it was a class conflict, if not even more so. With lying, I'm essentially okay with it, as long as the leaders aren't lying to themselves. First off, I don't believe in democracy. I'm an authoritarian, I don't think the people of a nation - especially the lower class - can make decisions that are both beneficial to them and consistent over the decades, even if they possess all the raw information, so I view lies to the population for the population's benefit as acceptable. I'd prefer a system where leaders can speak plainly about uncomfortable truths without fear of losing the support of their constituents - and thus their position and the ability to fix the underlying problems - but that isn't possible in a democracy. As long as the leaders don't drink their own Kool-Aid - as Napoleon has fallen victim to the illusions of his own grandeur before the Russian campaign - and at least the ones in charge know what's going on, there is no problem. Also, with Trump's lies, it's obvious that they're lies and mere rethorical tools, he isn't deceiving anybody. Or are people actually believing what he says? Secondly, it is probably due to a difference in our political cultures. I don't know where you're from (I assume the U.S.), but our country (Hungary) doesn't have a democratic tradition. The time period between our compromise with the Austrians in 1867 and the outbreak of WW1, and the 1930s - when the country was a kingdom without a king, ruled by regent Horthy and his aristocrats - are viewed as the two modern golden ages of our history. We were a monarchy until the 1940s, then we had half a century's worth of communist rule, and we only became a republic about 30 years ago, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. During that transition and since then, democracy has failed us over and over again, with the corrupt remnants of the Soviet era still running most of the country, and being the only options on the ballot. The public podium and the parliament itself are, and have always been for grandiose statements and speeches filled with pathos, not for discussing the political and economical reality of the situation. Actual politics is, and has always been done through personal interactions between politicians, out of the public's view. When a politician makes a public speech, it is simply assumed that he'll distort the truth to further his agenda. That might be why Trump's lies don't phase me as much. I highly doubt Trump wants popularity for popularity's sake, and that he's as incompetent as you say. Most likely, he intends to use the public support he builds for either a huge internal reform, or drastic steps in foreign policy. From what we've seen so far, I'm pretty sure that one of his end goals is to create a sort of splendid isolation for the United States, somewhat akin to the shift in British policy from the direct interventions of the 18th century to the economical manipulation and their constant looming presence, but very little direct meddling during the 19th century. And, to achieve that, he might rely on the direct support of his constituents and the pressure gained from that, as opposed to the appeasement of the political establishment's entrenched figures. Of course, we can only speculate, but I think you're underestimating the man. I don't necessarily agree that this is a bad platform to have this discussion. I find that forums set up specifically for political debate tend to either get extremely toxic, due to one side assuming the hostility of the other, or they turn into self-indulgent thought bubbles, as one side eventually just leaves the discussion. I prefer discussions that are born organically, and are tied to specific topics, as opposed to artificial forums created with the sole goal of discussing anything political.

We can't know the character of Trump's soul, nor should we really try. It is a completely valid point. You have many. I just am hopelessly confused about where reasonable admonishment with powerful rhetoric begins and where unreasonable vitriolic speech ends. Its a fine line clouded with entire communities of perspectives. Okay, caught me. I was leaning on the historical fiction of the French Revolution being the proletariat rising up against the bourgeoisie. However, I do find it funny that you both care about historical accuracy but don't care about the president lying. I am sure there is an interesting distinction there that deserves a different conversation. The lying is important for the same reason certain norms were kept in Roman society; because, when the norms start slipping so does the entire society. If you don't at least act as if there some sanctity in the political system then you might as well not have one. Ex: The filibuster rule doesn't actually matter but the bipartisan feeling that allowed it to persist does. Lying erodes the integrity of the institution which is intangible, like social trust, but countries with higher social trust do better. Of course politicians will lie, but it is naively pessimistic to say it so dismissively, as if it didn't matter. (or perhaps I am naively optimistic.) I don't really believe Trump is a capitalist at heart. I think his actions make more sense if you look at him as an incompetent person who will do what he can to be liked at least by someone. The strange thing is that Obamacare is a capitalist solution, even if it is not completely laissez faire. It just bothers me when politicians act against the interests of their own electorate, which Trump does. Trump's reprehensibility lies, for me at least, in the fact that he is incompetently rushing things in order to try and appease his base. There is something gross about valuing what you look like over actual change (the factory he stopped from shutting down before he took office is an example of that). It has little to do with him being a capitalist or not, nor about any political disagreement. It has more to do with method.

Uggo72NsVox--ngCoAEC.8RnR6-pgw7s8S1yANHWBM0		1	2017-05-02 00:21:26	RacconAndMT	Lee Koontz Are you still being taught that crap about the French revolution? Tocqueville is rolling in his grave. (if you're not interested in history, feel free to skip the next 3 paragraphs) The revolution wasn't carried out by the peasants. It was carried out by the people of the city of Paris, and their intellectual and business-owner agitators. The peasantry was largely apathetic towards, and - after the deposition of the king - strongly opposed to the revolution. That is why the peasants - who wanted their king back - stood behind their nobility and started royalist revolts all over the country, the largest one erupting in France's most impoverished region, the Vendée. The republican government responded to the Vendée revolt by sending an army of 150 thousand to the region - including death corps somewhat akin to the German Einsatzgruppen, referred to at the time as "infernal collumns" - who bloodily crushed the revolting army, held show trials for, and executed the revolt's leaders, and afterwards proceeded to commit the first modern act of genocide against the region's civillian population. Many veterans of the American War of Independence actually took the side of the royalists during the revolts (both in the Vendée, and everywhere else in the country), Lafayette himself was a constitutional monarchist, and had to flee France, as the revolution's leaders put out a warrant for his arrest, after which he probably would have been executed. So yes, I'll take the side of the peasants and their king, over the revolution's bloody-handed butchers, and their rootless city-dwelling mobs. The famine in France was caused mainly by natural events, and was actually over by the time of the revolution. Grain and bread prices were on the decline in the late 1780s. You know why Louis and Marie Antoinette were actually executed? Upon entering French land, the leaders of the Austro-Prussian army issued a manifesto to the people of Paris, threatening the city's destruction, if they didn't lay down their arms. The revolution's leaders in response got their angry mobs fired up, they stormed several royal estates, massacring the guards and servants, they had the royal family arrested, and, half a year later, when those coalition forces were driven out of France, they held show trials for the king and queen, after which they were executed, as a show of force to the intervening royalist powers. After that, the prince, Louis-Charles - called king Louis XVII by the royalists - was placed in the hands of a shoemaker, who was charged with making him a "good citizen". The 8-year-old Louis was then repeatedly abused by his guardian, he soon fell sick, and, due to being neglected and ignored, ended up dying. What would the royal couple have been tried for? For doing their best to run the country, and for refusing the demands of a gang of ruthless thugs? By the way, my apologies, for some reason I thought they ended up killing 2 of their kids, that was wrong, the younger son whom I thought of actually died a couple of years earlier due to a sickness. The king's older daughter was just locked up in solitary confinement for about 3 years. 2 and a half years after her father's execution, and a couple months after her little brother's death, she was finally told about what had happened to her family, after which she became slightly unhinged, though she ended up living until the 1850s. Also, the graves of the king's 2 younger kids were desecrated under the republican leadership's orders. Okay, history lesson over. I think you can chalk it up to my jaded, post-Soviet Central European viewpoint, but I don't give a single crap about Trump lying. He's a politician, of course he lies through his teeth. I'm not that familiar with American political culture, so I don't know how this is viewed over there. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he was doing it more to spite media outlets, who have been slandering and smearing his name for the past 2 years, as opposed to actually deceiving anybody. Trump is a capitalist at heart, and he believes in trickle-down economics. Yes, the new healthcare plan means tax cuts for the rich. In his view, the rich will use that extra cash to expand their businesses, create more jobs, and raise wages to encourage productive workers. I don't agree with him, I'm not a capitalist myself (at least I don't believe in the total and all-encompassing capitalism the American "right-wing" propagates), but painting him as a demon who's stealing money from the pockets of the starving is extremely unfair. Also, public healthcare doesn't actually guarantee good healthcare. My country has a tax-funded healthcare system, we're all "covered", in theory. My dad, who's disabled (got his left arm ripped off in an accident about a decade back), was told by his doctor that he needs to go to the hospital and get examined urgently, because he's at the risk of having a heart attack. He got an appointment for about a month and a half later, because there's already a waiting list. Plus, he can't afford his normal meds from his pension, which he only gets a "discount" for due to our tax-funded system. My 93-year-old grandma fractured her femure-neck about 2 months back. They brought her to the hospital, where they had to wait until the next day with her surgery, because they didn't have any blood in stock, and had to bring it in by train from another nearby hospital. Then, she was basically thrown out of the hospital after 4-5 days (way earlier than she should have), because they were running out of beds for "more urgent" cases. There's the beauty of a centralised, and extremely corrupt healthcare-system. Now these problems can be solved by decentralising, and having anti-corruption methods (the problem in my country is that the whole damn system is rotten up to the government and the prime minister, but that's beside the point). Trump's way of doing that is outsourcing it to business owners, who will know what pharmaceutics they'll need to produce, how they'll need to run their hospitals, and who can't afford to be corrupt, because they'll be outdone by their competitors. Same goes for health insurance, the local insurance company will know what offers will do best, and they can't skin their customers, because they'll just switch to another company. I wonder how much Trump's views are influenced by Melania, and her experience in titoist Slovenia. Now do I agree with those views? Not at all, I'm all for a state-run healthcare system (with sufficient steps to root out corruption and combat inefficiency, of course). However, the capitalist solution is a solution. You can disagree with him all you want, that's not my point. But stripping him of his humanity altogether? I mean just listen to what people are saying, and read what news outlets are writing. Look at that fellow above: "You can't dehumanize someone that is a horrible person already." Just because you disagree with someone's politics, he doesn't become any less of a human. That's the path leading down to the suspension of political dialogue, thus to mass political violence, and to one-party-states. You don't want to go down that road.

Sure, its awful they killed them (especially the children) rather than put them through a proper judicial system (children exempted, of course) but I still feel that the the poor French peasants were more just and deserve more respect than Trump. They were starving under a repressive elitist regime, so at least their deplorable actions can be understood as a reasonable response to abuse, while Trump...Anyway, here are two good enough reasons to find Trump reprehensible: 1. He lies. He promotes lying. And by doing this he distances us from real problems. Yes, lying isn't a new thing, but when lying becomes the rule it becomes truly malignant. His staffers literally do it for sport. Here is a source: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/ Another one: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/23/trump-loves-media-reporters-white-house-215043 2. The health care bill he support/supported is basically a tax break for the rich. I don't know if it is better if he is ignorant and pretending not to be or if he actually knows the awfulness of his plan. I suspect the former. I suggest going to the CBO website if you want to rigorously check me. It is a very "let them eat cake" type of bill.

Being an illegal immigrant makes you a criminal. Is "bullying criminals" wrong? "reverse years of civil rights accomplishments (for example removing the transgender bathroom guidelines)" Are you actually calling that a civil rights accomplishment? Does that actually matter? Anyway, the way it was handled (the "you can go into any bathroom if you say you're that gender" policy) was bloody dumb, ask any worthwile psychologist, and he'll tell you that identity is a construct negotiated between the individual and society, not just the individuals make-believe. Also, it's simply not logical. I don't know how it is in the U.S., but over here, men's and women's restrooms are equipped differently. A public men's room will usually have 1 or 2 toilets and a row of pissoirs, while a women's room will have 5-8 toilets. Obviously, if you don't have a penis, you can't use a pissoir, so you're taking up somebody's space who really has to take a dump, and if you're going into the women's room with a penis, you could take care of your business much quicker in the men's room. I'm not actually against transgender bathroom "rights", but the approach was way off, it should either be carried out by creating a third, separate bathroom (though actually enforcing that might be unfair towards business owners), or tying it to a certificate from a doctor, saying "he/she is undergoing/has undergone sex change, effectively counts as the other gender". Taking a step back was the right move from Trump, as the existing policies were plainly stupid. However, what civil rights accomplishments has he reversed? And I'm sorry, but actual civil rights accomplishments. I don't count being able to piss where you want as MLK-level stuff. Trump's move in the Middle East was tactical and well-executed, though I don't agree with it myself. He didn't actually go to war, neither did he create a perpetual hellhole of drone-bombing, he demonstrated U.S. power projection with one precise strike at a military target. Trump didn't create a vaccuum, the airfield was left functional after the attack, and I imagine the Syrians got it back to normal in a week. Meanwhile, he dealt a much more grievous blow to islamism, by taking out their base in Afghanistan. Afghanistan, Libya, and several African states serve as the breeding ground for terrorist organisation, as, exploiting the extremely weak control of the states, they use these areas as training grounds for their elite units. That's why the French are in the Sahel, and if Trump's attack against Assad has provided the islamists with any advantage, his bombing in Afghanistan set them back tenfold. While I don't agree with his attack against Syria, I don't think it's as catastrophic as you characterise. "He gets all 3 by saying things that inflame the white working class Americans that suffered the inevitable deindustrialization of the Rust Belt, the Deep South, etc." So what you're saying is that there is an impoverished working class in the United States, that their grievances have gone so far unaddressed, and that now Trump is addressing those problems? And that's somehow bad? I'm sorry, but are you bloody serious? First, you criticise him for disenfranchising minorities, now you criticise him for enfranchising a group with actual issues? And how exactly is this deindustrialisation inevitable? Why do you say that? "He is objectively a populist demagogue." Demagogue is a subjective word by definition, you can't say that someone is objectively a demagogue. A demagogue is a mob leader by definition, saying "populist demagogue" is redundant. However, may I ask, what's your problem with populism? It means favouring the common people over an entrenched elite. We've seen what happened in Rome, when the populist, but peaceful Gracchi where shot down by the Optimates. You eventually get a Caesar. If you value your republic, let your populist carry out his reforms. I don't get this condemnation of populism in democracies anyway, I mean these states are about doing what the majority of people want to do, yet now, for some reason, we brand those that promise to do what the majority wants to be done. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in democracy, I'm an authoritarian myself, but I didn't imagine there were so many like-minded people out in the world, especially the West. Most of your second paragraph is a character judgement, if you don't explain why you don't like what he's doing, I can't reply to it. "Donald Trump is a bad president, and it's not really a debate anymore." Mate, the U.S. is a democracy (or at least it's relatively close to it). If you don't debate something, the other side wins by default. If the other side wins a debate, you end up with 4 more years of Trump. Now if he ends up running against Clinton again, I'm totally fine with that, but I imagine you'd prefer someone else to be president of the U.S. I suggest you start debating.

He's using his position of power exactly how he promised; to bully minorities, reverse years of civil rights accomplishments (for example removing the transgender bathroom guidelines), and furthermore, he even managed to BREAK one of his primary promises: to stay out of the Middle East. He attacked Syria shortly after screaming about how bad it is for us to get involved. I don't think I need to get into how this opens the door for jihadists, terrorists, etc. to fill the vacuum that is created. There's a RIGHT way to break our quote "cumbersome political establishment". A politician that does nothing is better than one that fucks over everything and reverses progress made previously. The one who screams the loudest is not always the one that is right. We have a president that is addicted to attention, power, and money. He gets all 3 by saying things that inflame the white working class Americans that suffered the inevitable deindustrialization of the Rust Belt, the Deep South, etc. He is objectively a populist demagogue.

They are so insecure that they are unwilling to accept that the world is ultimately a safer place than the "Crime is on the rise in the US" screaming zealots, yet so nationalist that they are convinced their country is so much better than EVERY other country, because Europe is obviously being blown up by ISIS, right? No. There are over a 743,100,000 people in Europe living their lives peacefully. And once every other week, tops, there's a terrorist attack that kills usually less than 5-6 people, or 0.0000005% of the population. The "terrorist attacks" are in reality usually native-born psychopaths who likely would have killed people for other reasons, if it wasn't for Islamic extremism. Everything is being blown out of proportion, and it seems nobody is in tune with reality anymore. This is impacting everything. Right now, our president in the Oval Office is getting his primary information and even guidance from Fox and Friends and Alex Jones, writing up tax plans to cut taxes for the ultra-rich, to lower the federal revenue, raise debt, and give the federal government less money to repair our crumbling infrastructure, to name one thing. Why are baseless claims and conspiracy theories suddenly so popular? I would say Trump is a cause, but he's actually the effect... or is he both? It's a chicken and egg scenario. All I know is people are fucking ignorant as hell nowadays, and I don't even know where to begin trying to explain why. Public education ruining children's drive to learn is one possible contributing fact. Everyone, just fucking cool your shit, try and help others, and hell, perhaps open a book every once in a while.

Their fathers or grand fathers emigrated and they were born in Europe. They were citizen and thus had nothing to do with immigration. But you know what the funniest thing is here? Even with the rise of terrorism in western Europe, the number of homicides there is 2 to 5 times lower than in the US depending on the country. So yeah, if adopting European policies allows the US to pull closer to their homicide rates, it's a no brainer really. Next time you try to make an argument, maybe grow a brain before.

Your statement is, that the crimes of a single person/group justify the whole generalization of the entire population of muslims. Thats a pretty bold statement and i like to see the study that backs this nonsense up. Anyway, if you think your examples prooved anything, then you should take some lectures about scientific argumentation. PS: Your links arent working anyway.

It's what economists called the "lost decade." The Obama years on the other hand gave us the recovery and the longest period of steady job growth in almost a century. No market crashes, no bank bailouts. Steady market growth too. If a Republican did that they would be etching his face on Mt Rushmore.

What good did his education do anyone but him? Obama and Trump are both crooks, although Obama's smoother. I'll give him that. You probably still believe Obama actually gave a sh!t about ordinary people, for example, when he nearly always did the least for them he could possibly get away with. You almost certainly don't know what the Podesta emails show us, that three months before the 2008 election Obama's entire cabinet had already been picked out for him by Citigroup. Obama could have been FDR. Instead he was George H. W. Bush with a more vicious foreign policy. And he was worse on civil liberties. Get to know his record, not just the illusion of it.

When you look past the image they want you to see, they don&#39;t look like righteous warriors to me. Everything they say to the camera seems fake and suspicious. if you are not a wise, humble , and good natured person on the inside, everything you say to try to convince people who know better otherwise sounds disgusting and fake.<br />I think there are good people out there, but they are the only group of people that can truly be called the minority.

Then I wait for the next batch.<br />I just don&#39;t and can&#39;t control who does what. I don&#39;t know the people, I don&#39;t know their jobs.

What idiot makes outlandish claims that any sane person knows is impossible. He's done next to nothing. I will say this, this is an extremely funny administration and I won't to thank him for all the laughs. He makes Richard Nixon look good!

Even the liberals won&#39;t mock his extremist version of judaism (as if there&#39;s a moderate judaism). But watch how the same media throws a fit if a Christian doesn&#39;t want to bake a wedding cake for homos.	UCSDvHhZh8kMNVsXu5R_ihZg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSDvHhZh8kMNVsXu5R_ihZg	0

Most archives agrees that while married to him she was the force behind the renovations of the Casinos (Atlantic City) and the Trump tower. To confirm my assumption: compare Tiffany&#39;s temperament with her half siblings...just saying.... she&#39;s more bling bling like, well her mother...different DNA....

Was listening to her recount her grandmother&#39;s story and it was quite beautiful. It was moving not simply because of the happy ending to a rough start of her grandmother&#39;s life, but especially because there was little of the kind of surface polish that Ivanka seems to go for when talking in an interview. It seems both would-have-been/is first daughters are a study in contrast. Ivanka is about vagueness, appearances, profit and throwing right sound bytes, and from the interview I just heard, Chelsea seemed anything but. Her words added into narratives, and gave details. It wasn&#39;t Trumpy, where they just ask for a blind trust from us that they know what&#39;s better for us (&quot;Believe me&quot;). This president and his family are quite an unfortunate dent in our great democracy. I hope we will have enough civic energy to undo the harm they are doing in years to come.

He has turned his private club/home into the Winter White House, he&#39;s appointed people to head positions completely 180 of what should be required, he&#39;s caused doubt for real Press Media, and instead praises &#39;Fox News, and Tabloids! Study history on how many dictatorships began, we are living in such historic times, and if we continue to allow the Trump dynasty to grow/govern, the USA will no longer be a free democratic society, and instead will become another dictatorship.

UgjpQ3LvKa90fngCoAEC	0	0	2017-04-25 14:31:43	What A Marvel	It&#39;s like all the people who watch to much reality tv and think action movies are grounded in reality are trying to turn politics into the schlock that they watch because the old days of men and women reading news (with no opinions attached) and CSPAN are to boring. If you are incapable of watching CSPAN or long civil forums about the complexities of climate change or global terrorism then politics isn&#39;t really your thing. I&#39;d advice you to go back to your honey boo boo and dancing with the stars. I&#39;m not calling you an idiot I&#39;m just saying politics isn&#39;t for you if your opinions are borrowed from CNN Fox &quot;News&quot; or any other corporate media outlet. Same goes for TYT, Louder with Crowder and a slew of other opinionated shows. If you&#39;re doing this I&#39;d say you&#39;re intellectually lazy and you must not care to have others make up your mind for you with half truths. I would include people like john Oliver but their comedians first which is disturbing when you think about how corporate and independent media have failed us that comedy shows are what many of us turn to. Jon Stewart preached about how absurd it is on face value and yet so many hate media but can&#39;t identify that at its core these outlets are designed to be sensational, divisive, and for some entertaining. That&#39;s not news. So if you like Fox or TYT because they give the other side then you&#39;ve been punk&#39;d and you&#39;re what the cool kids call a sheeple. Embrace your political ignorance and you&#39;ll be better for it. And if you genuinely want to know the truth you&#39;ll seek it elsewhere and if it&#39;s too much work then perhaps that life telling you to focus on something else and own up to your ignorance it&#39;s the wisest thing you could do.

What difference does it make if it's Obama's school records specifically? *Everyone's* records have the same limitation. I can't see when you went to school, where you went, what grades you got, or how you got into school. You can't see any of that for my records. This is the same for everyone, regardless of someone's status as a public figure. Celebrities, politicians, private citizens, we all have the same rule put in place which prevents others from seeing our school records without our consent.

That's not biased at all. (/sarcasm) Since Factcheck's word isn't good enough, let's take someone else's. The Society of Professional Journalists, for example. https://www.spj.org/ferpa3.asp#2 "Academic Records — A student’s academic records are subject to disclosure under FERPA only with a parent or eligible student’s consent or pursuant to one of the exceptions to consent set forth in the federal act. " Not good enough? Let's see the National Center for Education Statistics. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/web/97859.asp "Student education records are official and confidential documents protected by one of the nation's strongest privacy protection laws, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, defines education records as all records that schools or education agencies maintain about students. [...] Education records include a range of information about a student that is maintained in schools in any recorded way, such as handwriting, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film, microfilm, and microfiche. Examples are: -Date and place of birth, parent(s) and/or guardian addresses, and where parents can be contacted in emergencies; - Grades, test scores, courses taken, academic specializations and activities, and official letters regarding a student's status in school; -Special education records; -Disciplinary records; -Medical and health records that the school creates or collects and maintains; -Documentation of attendance, schools attended, courses taken, awards conferred, and degrees earned; -Personal information such as a student's identification code, social security number, picture, or other information that would make it easy to identify or locate a student." So, TL;DR: Obama's grades and school records aren't public record, no matter how you slice it.

We don&#39;t want corrupt political insiders like Hillary Clinton who funnels money through the Clinton foundation in exchange for political favors. The sooner you libtards figure this out and accept it, the sooner you will realize how hypocritical you are. You guys (liberals) elected a man president of the United States who was unknown to anyone outside of Chicago politics in 2008. He was a 1 term Senator known as a community organizer who made shady land deals with people like Tony Rezko who contributed money to his campaign in exchange for government public housing contracts.

We don&#39;t even know what Obama&#39;s grades were since he had all his records sealed. Obama went to Harvard, and then became a community organizer. I mean seriously, wtf does that even mean? <br /><br />So while I don&#39;t think Kushner should be anywhere near the White House, let alone heading up all of these important departments and programs, is he really any worse than Obama? Obama talked about Ribs and pussy in college at a library during a speech he gave. Trump talked about being able to grab pussy in a backroom conversation due to the brainwashing power that celebrity status has over the retarded masses. <br /><br />One was a national controversy that people are still making protest signs over, the other has never even been aired or talked about.

Obama was involved in politics for years before he tried to take on the responsibility of President. Not to mention Trump's incident happened in 2005 when he was 58 Where as if Obama made such a statement it would have had to have been in 1990 when he was around 27 (18 years before taking office). You can hardly blame the media for sensationalising comments that 60 year old celebrities make over the random statements of some 27 year old attending Harvard.

The majority of the people in the US did not vote for Trump. I agree that people were desperate, but you can see what desperation leads to. Rather than making an educated decision, those people chose to believe someone who is a conman, a salesman. What do they both have in common? They will do whatever it takes to close the deal. They will lie through their teeth to you, and never bat an eye. Which is exactly what Trump did. He made promises he hasn't kept, and more than likely, won't keep. He told them what they wanted to hear. He played off their fears, and concerns knowing that would get more people to fall for his BS. He campaigned in states where they've lost manufacturing jobs, and coal jobs, on the promise to bring those jobs back. Those jobs aren't ever coming back, but the people fell for his BS and believed him. There were other issues he campaigned on by playing off people's fears. NOT ONCE did these people ever question how was he going to do this. Instead, they just cheered never once asking themselves how. They should have. They should have asked him where would he get the money to build the wall? If Mexico, is going to pay for the wall, how will you get Mexico to pay for it? How will you bring jobs back? What changes will you implement to bring them back? People have to learn to ask questions, to think critically. We've seen what making impulsive decisions has done. QUESTION AUTHORITY.

The conflicts of interest at this level should get him impeached NOW but of course RNC in entirety have their balls cut off for their own draconian agendas - to take us back 500 yrs- that they would rather hold their noses hearing trump&#39;s ridiculous babble every single day! How the Trump supporters continue to have hopes in this appalling incompetent joke is incomprehensible. It&#39;s likely that they tune out anything they don&#39;t want to hear, and watch fox news all day long, just like their conman in chief.

Its honestly really sad how much youre trying to target Trump and his family, you used to actually be funny and prove a point.

(just incase you edit) A lye is a liquid metal hydroxide obtained by leaching ashes (containing largely potassium carbonate or "potash"), or a strong alkali which is highly soluble in water producing caustic basic solutions. "Lye" is commonly an alternative name of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or historically potassium hydroxide (KOH), though the term "lye" refers to any member of a broad range of metal hydroxides. Please don't make mocking you this easy.	UCidtUtvR19VsXofSllYufeA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCidtUtvR19VsXofSllYufeA	1	UghuWbTtroNtIngCoAEC	Guts

And make fun of both sides so to speak. But this episode was all trump bashing. even though I admit he&#39;s not the best president. Your claims effectively talked him down, &#39;claimed&#39; that his children ran the USA, and said they did a bad job regardless. <br />Yet trump has already done great things, like his victory speech was totally optional, yet he said some actually kind words about his opponent.<br />He also immediately went to work on everything he said he would do, even if he was mostly unsuccessful.<br />I dislike it when you call him an idiot out of spite, and would prefer you call him out for things he actually did wrong that left a negative impact. Like Bombing an airbase that could&#39;ve caused WW3 for example.	UCJFDjPLxu1XRkrZE4Hgfddw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFDjPLxu1XRkrZE4Hgfddw	0

Most of the things you mentioned are what should be the standard for a president, not something to be praised for. Also, in this episode of LWT it would make little sense to add a random compliment of Trump since it is not really talking about Trump (but it was also unnecessary to jab at him at random points in the section).

UggCNPoVUojbR3gCoAEC.8Rl7GM9r30A8Rpfy4G9L8W		17	2017-04-26 20:32:13	Brandon Willis	Not true. Many engineers work together to design a building. The architect designs it, the civil engineer makes sure the structure is built with the right size materials to support itself, the electrical engineer designs the electrical components of the building, and the mechanical engineer designs the HVAC (heating, venting, and air conditioning), fire sprinkler protection, and plumbing. I worked as a designer drafter for a mechanical engineer for years and we did building design daily. That's all we did.

We&#39;ve got some pretty good policies, for starters on healthcare, climate change, and the economy -- but most of our time is spent on critiquing our enemies. Not that I don&#39;t love these segments, but we could use some variety and something that can convincing opponents in a positive way, instead of riling them up.

Ugh4Tlqa93M4R3gCoAEC	1	0	2017-04-25 01:28:59	Adam Wiens	I am a conservative libertarian, and I used to be a big fan of John. However he has slowly transitioned from doing the non partisan exposes that I fell in love with years ago, to doing takedowns of political enemies. While John has always leaned left, that has not always been the focus of his show. He used to make arguments that conservatives and liberals alike could agree on, issues that truly mattered to Americans. Fast forward to today, and Last Week Tonight&#39;s focus is now to smear politicians who John disagrees with. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are some great points in these videos too, however many of Johns points are completely based upon ad hominem attacks. Both of these approaches are valid since the show is a comedy show obviously, and John can do whatever he wants to do on his show. However I miss the old days when I could look to John Oliver to tell me about the injustices and systematic problems that plague America.

UghT6Pa4VLRT83gCoAEC.8Rl00ve7sQs8RnnE7D_txe		1	2017-04-26 02:57:14	Jaes	Actually, if you look into the voter bases on who voted in 2012 versus 2016 (rather who didn't vote), it's actually quite cunning how the Trump campaign won the swing states. There was a noticeable chunk of the voter base that stayed home in 2012 because the Republican nominee was an out of touch Mormon and hell would freeze over before they'd vote Democrat. The Trump campaign focused on getting these voters to the Ballot Box. We all see how that worked out. It didn't help that the voters that typically go Democrat decided to make a protest vote for candidates that were laughable at best to the point that I can't even remember their names at the time I'm typing this message. With the combination of energizing previously ignored voting base and millions of votes in protest, it was a forgone conclusion and no one really saw it coming until Election night.

Or that slashing the EPA is a great way to save money even though money wont be worth much when penguins are swimming in our back yard. Even just the vague concept of some millionaire real estate tycoon putting on a red trucker hat and acting like he is out there for struggling rural Americans is just asinine.

I object to the endless use of the word "race" in referring to an election. Monty Python and the Holy Grail asserted that _people in ponds tossing swords about_ was no way to be choosing a government. Neither is treating it as any kind of sporting event.

Hits in baseball are not equal to American votes, and a presidential election is not comparable to a game. It doesn't matter how many people voted in CA, you can't concentrate the extra votes Hillary received and say "they're all from here, so they shouldn't count!". Hillary received votes in red states too, just like trump received votes in blue states...though they don't win the presidency, they all count.

That's exactly how Trump approaches every reaction he has about the scope of what a running government actually consists of. He always seems so surprised at how different it is from any of his corrupt as fuck businesses. This is just another way for him to conduct his businesses. How is this crap with Mar-A-Lago and people being able to pay 200,000 to his business to get access to him NOT corruption? Isn't that imeachable grounds right there? Man get those crooks out.

But actually Trump is breaking the spirit of the law giving his kids positions in the government the dumb congress forgot to add ..."Whether paid or unpaid", Trump is skirting the law by not paying his kids. Please someone take this Trump Admin to court over his kids holding jobs in the White House, I'm sure the judge will interpret the laws much like I am, there is no way Trump is not violating the Spirit of the law. What Trump is doing employing his kids in the White House is like a man watching a mother and kids dying before his eyes and not lifting a finger to aid them, can't charge him for murder, but we all know he did, even though he didn't shot or stab them.

Also, please don't hold Donald's horrific incompetence against most Americans. He exploited some of the worst elements in our society, and catered to those who were desperate with lies. He shouldn't have won, and he shouldn't have ever been a major candidate, but most Americans are better than Donald. He's less well-informed than the average college graduate, and he's far less honest or honorable than any normal sampling of the population. It is shameful that we're now being governed by one of the worst among us, and it would be understandable if you held that fact against us to a degree, but please don't think that we're all, or that even very many of us are like him. Best wishes to you. I hope that Germany is able to hold together the EU. Many societies around the world are grappling with the massive social and technological changes that have rocked our time. I wish the US could be counted on as a pillar of stability in this time, but it seems we cannot. Perhaps Germany will show greater leadership in this trying year.

What's shocking is the power the majority party has these days - they can literally vote to change the rules, no democrats needed. They've already started doing that. There's a great Vox article that sums up issues that were in Congress during the Obama admin. While the government has deteriorated since then, it explains how the American political parties have become more extreme and less representative of the people. It's important to note, however, that I (and many other Americans) still believe that we can rise up peacefully, uniting over issues that would never bridge politicians of opposing parties on the Senate floor, and force the government to change. It *just* takes a lot of willpower (anger). http://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7978823/congress-secrets	UCiR6F_xghBjX3W-CtNHsO8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiR6F_xghBjX3W-CtNHsO8A	1	UggaQxkqab_2FXgCoAEC	kopfoderzahl08

It's ethically beyond wrong, but legally permitted. And were this any other government it's a flaw that would get fixed, but that's not happening. What's happening here is not unlike what's happening elsewhere: angry people stood up and shouted down the establishment while being countered by a weak and divided opposotion party with an inpopular front runner. By any sense of logic or basic human sense and decency this should never have happened. But it was a perfect storm of stupid and the media in particular is still being tossed about on raging waves of shit while also being weakened by their own lack of ethics and trustworthiness. Long story short, never claim [insert outrageous bullshit here] could never happen in [place where you are from] because guess what? Aunt Sanity has left for vacation in a nicer place and Crazy Uncle Batshit McLoonfuck is watching the place, and holy shit is he frightening the neighbors...

In a looks-driven world, a pretty woman gets more credit than she frequently merits. AND, it's all fake. Fake hair color, fake face paint, fake height with her perpetual heels, kept nipped, tucked, and botoxed with all unnatural means available only to the wealthy. BTW, I'm a pretty (by wildly different standards than Ivanka is pretty-but the world tells me so, nonetheless) woman a couple years older than her. She's at the age where she SHOULD have a couple crow's feet, esp after a pair of kids. She's as artificial in her beauty as she is in her internal content. Seriously, google tRump family photos, look for childhood Ivanka. She's nasty. She HAS to use artificial means to be 'beautiful'.

(1) Why is sex the first thing that comes to mind when Trump talks about his daughter? (2) What does that answer mean? Does it mean that both of them really like sex? Does it mean they have the same organs? Does it mean that they have it together? (3) HOW DOES TRUMP KNOW that his daughter's favorite thing is sex?

Everyone argue over the best voting method to elect a ruler for 4 years. That's stupid. No single individual should ever have the power in Democracy. Switzerland with its seven-headed government, that takes all its decisions at the majority of its members, proportionally elected parliament and direct vote by the people is the only democracy that I know that is worthy of its name. All the rest is a joke. I hate Trump, but had he lost, why would it have been fair to ignore 48% of the electorate during 4 years? On projects, you have to choose, say yes or know, but on power and representatives, elections should be about determining the equilibrium of political forces not about electing someone alone at the top.

Utopianism is the source of collectivism is thebsource if liberalism, of which socialism and communism are proxy to. Conservatism accrues power as Liberalism disperses it. For this simple emperical fact alone, ALL dictators and fascist states have been conservative to their respective brandings, contrary to US Capital Establishment revisionism- and your mal-socialisation. As conservatism accrues power, its proxy devices such as capitalism will do so as well. Where accretion of wealth or power hit critical mass, we get dictators, fascist states, billionaires, and corporations. Liberal/collectivist constructs don't use money or other CAPITAL devices as driving motivators to begin with, thus all "failed" soc/com was actually state capitalism. Only a thief such as capitalism would ever use a physical medium to express an ideological device. Also to note- there's no such thing as a "conservative christian" when christ and the bible are liberal/collectivist constructs. That christ sacrificed his individual self to save the collective is the defining essence of collectivism, source if liberalism... You really have no business trying to challenge me... you cant even grasp the concepts enough to wield them without harming yourself...

He literally said that nuking the Middle East to fight ISIS wasn't off the table. Clinton may have been a hawk, but Trump is a rabid lice-infested inbred buzzard with a faulty cloaca, one dead eye, and an image of a half-dead shrew tattooed on its one functional cornea.

He never had good ROI´s, all his products have failed, he is a horrendously bad businessman. The only way he stayed afloat was by lending millions from others, including the Russians, and focusing on his brand. Even IF he only got millions that he brought up to billions, there is a lot wrong with that. Imagine trump being born into a poor family. He would NEVER have the chance to get as rich as he is now. The more money you have, the easier it is to make more money. If a capable smart person was born into the trump family, that person would be way richer.Social mobility is almost zero, when you´re an educated person from a middle class family, you are 2.5 times less likely to become rich than if you are an uneducated person in a rich family. That says more than enough.	UCpzEiXcHw0kRgAxscQQq4pw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzEiXcHw0kRgAxscQQq4pw	1	UgiwlZXMI3xvL3gCoAEC	NG

Trump&#39;s victory was a way for the American people to say &quot;up yours&quot; to the establishment of both parties. They wanted to try something different, and maybe that means putting a brilliant strategist like Jared in charge of Middle East negotiations.

Today banks create loans out of this air, {they don&#39;t lend out their customers money}. Every cent of our money supply are banks loan promissory notes, including coinage, owed to the banks. The &quot;Federal&#39; Reserve System is privately owned that includes all state, national, and commercial banks. CONGRESS could repeal the &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve Act, and issue, debt free, US Treasury money, for its own needs, exactly the way banks issue their loans. This US Treasury money would be more than enough for all public and private needs to keep our economy healthy, forever. Treasury money would be backed by what would produce, just as indebted bank money is today. The American people must demand Congress to get rid of our current bank money that&#39;s ripping us all off.	UCPbU8Hfhjns0cnjk7kZDsKA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPbU8Hfhjns0cnjk7kZDsKA	0

It's actually disgusting. Anyone who buys that BS must be missing quite a number of braincells; be that due to the toxic effects of drinking too much kool-aid or --whatever! If you act like a news show, dress like it, take interests in roughly the same issues, do journalistic legwork and research (albeit of the one-eyed variety) -- at what point do you have to be measured by journalistic standards? - esp. considering, that they pride themselves in being an alternative to the bad media the US is plagued with. It's sophistry to play the "we are just comedians" card, nothing but! - sophistry! And even if they weren't journalists; that does not put you above journalistic ethics in any way; it just means, that you cannot be called "Not a journalist" the other day, when being called out for bad journalism -- because you already aren't one!

They slither so close to the ground that a successful woman from a highly successful family makes them realize how unimportant they really are. Obama had his mother-in-law living in the White House, babysitting grown girls, If PRESIDENT TRUMP wants his daughter and her family in the White House, I don&#39;t blame him. There are still people from the disease known as the liberals, and rinos who can&#39;t be trusted. Good for him for having his daughter and son-in-law as his confidants. So get over it snowflakes.

So I think it is best to keep clear from conjectures. I mean, there is enough to deal with the actual facts. Plus it is insulting to those people, about whom we do not know very much. And as in any good democracy, they are allowed to explain their own views. What should be fair to us, should be fair to them. Remember Mrs. Obama "when they go low, you go high". Just saying.

This leads to the question are his kids good advisors? The apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the orange fits perfectly. <br />Concerning Jared here is what I think: He got this unbelievably 1,000,000 tasks which he obviously cannot deal with. He will apply it to his administration stuff. Trump and his family belive the stuff will solve all issues for them because they have to and they know better anyway. If success is coming they will present Jared as the genius behind it and as the potential next president. They will tell the world if somebody is able to handle so many issues he will be also able to run the USA. <br />And after Trump eveybody else who seems moderate and smart, thanks to the media and their reputation managers, will be elected by the people.

They are like a couple kindergarden Leftist Libtards giving advice, when they should be taking it. And unfortunately children are massively influential in the lives of parents. Kushner for one is a wholly-owned subsidiary of evil billionaire George (satan&#39;s imp) Soros.

I would rather see Stalin take over and actually bring some kind of law and order even if I don&#39;t agree with specifics of it than to have liberals in charge leading people with pipe dreams and lies.<br />I am very much against Trump, especially since he turned on Assad, but every time I see stuff like this I want to defend him and justify it to myself by him being the smallest turd of the bunch.<br /><br />BTW, Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) is a brilliant man.

Basically, if you are a guy and you criticize her, then people assume it must be because you have a problem with women in authority. And if you are a woman and you criticize her, it's because you are jealous of her somehow (looks, husband, position in society, etc.) And I think Ivanka knows that, and is leveraging it to her advantage.

You as the message receiver should always be filtering any messages through that bias. John Oliver is at least straightforward with his opinions, and he backs up said opinions with facts that speak to the truth of his opinion. Opinion and fact are like the difference between saying, "The color green, is the best color," and, "2 + 2 = 4 according to our natural numbers system." The problem is, with humans, we state opinion like fact, such as the statement, "There is no such thing as global warming." That's an opinion (and a dumb one in my opinion, pun intended). By stating this opinion as fact, I would be showing my own bias. But those who believe similarly immediately feel the pull of their own bias, and are more willing to take opinions as fact when said opinions correlate with their own worldview. This happens with anyone about his or her own opinions; it has several fancy names in academia if we cared enough. But there's another problem at work. To those who actually believe global warming is a myth, opinions in general seem to be taken as fact. Those who seems to be on the side of "alternate facts" in general seem to have this problem, in my opinion. How? Often, "Important People" say something completely fabricated for their own political reasons (their own biases being shown in that very choice, if you pay attention), that quote gets picked up by mainstream media and legitimized by giving equal air time against the facts themselves "in efforts to be impartial to the story," and then that message can be re-parroted out by the original speaker as if that speaker is now validated in that original flawed thinking. That's a nasty bit of circular reasoning there. Some of the problem is, in my opinion, the media pushing this idea of "equality through equal air time," which I detest. I'll go to another easy target to illustrate my thinking. Most of us who have done our homework have discovered that, out of all the scientists on Planet Earth itself, about 5% believe that global warming is a myth. The other 95% would disagree. You'd think mainstream media would reflect this idea; it doesn't. "Global warming is a myth" gets the same amount of air time, despite the very ridiculousness of its thinking. Why? We mustn't forget that media is just another business, and its purpose is to sell newspapers, generate watched airtime, create a viral video to get those all important clicks and likes, etc. Too, there's also the nature of truth versus fact, but don't even get me started on "truth;" what is truth, anyway? (I believe someone in the past said that once, and then washed his hands of it.) Just the conviction of your beliefs? Right-action thinking?

People perceive of her as a moderate just because she is a woman with three kids and liberals stereotype women with children as people more passionate about the women&#39;s issues than say, a white man. Ivanka isn&#39;t really for planned parenthood or any other kind of female empowerment programmes. You know who was though? - Bernie Sanders. He was the perfect choice for President and the stupid liberal media rallied against him in the greed of having a woman president. Now look how that played out.<br /><br />Well what&#39;s more to say? We&#39;re all truly fucked.	UCFuW65DR-TnVJBtCQGtXd2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFuW65DR-TnVJBtCQGtXd2Q	0

Weak and lazy. I also think that his perception of right and wrong doesn&#39;t apply to him. He seems to have no morals or ethics of any kind.

Imagine if you did an investigative report on what qualified Barack Obama to be the President of America, other than not being White that is, he missed the most votes out of any Senator and was a community organizer in Chiraq, obviously highly qualified. Everyone in the media swept his drug use, poor performance at University, Illegal activities and Socialistic sympathies under the rug and just metaphorically sucked his big black dick. Now that your ideology is falling apart John, you&#39;re now taking pot shots at individuals you know nothing about. Why were there no reports on the DNC scandals on this show. To call this show an unbiased news show is a joke and it&#39;s not ever funny. John Oliver go back to the posh wank festival in London you come from. You know nothing about America other than what&#39;s cool in New York City and California, which need I remind you isn&#39;t America, it&#39;s basically the American equivalent of London though. John Oliver sucking up to the worlds elite to push globalism on the masses since Jon Stewart made the mistake of bringing him on the Daily show before it went to shit. You knew that the media knows their out of touch when they had to wheel Jon Stewart out of retirement to support Hillary.

SOME FOLKS MIGHT CONSIDER IT TO BE THE INTERNET VERSION OF SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS, BUT IT JUST SHOWS HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE ABOUT THE SITUATION AT HAND. TYPING INCOMPREHENSIBLE NONSENSE THAT SHOWS HOW HARD YOU TOE THE PARTY LINE WILL ALSO HELP YOUR CASE. But seriously, turn off the Caps Lock. Also, maybe make a better case than just making blanket statements about democrats and liberals. What are they doing that is supposedly destroying America and why are the republicans considered the "saviors" of this great country when they so often don't seem to give much of a care for the working class when they finally hold office?

And you are one of its advocates. Past White House advisors are also major political powerhouses. Rahm Emmanuel, George Stephanopoulos, David Axelrod and Karl Rove to name a few and all of them highly opinionated and have agendas. At the end of the day, you don't want an advisor. You want a pretty face to distract from the often times ugly face of our current administration while offering no real advice and just sucking up to daddy. *beeelch* You should really man up and face reality Jerry instead of talking out of your ass.

My mom was the stylist that did her hair. She was instructed to not look her in the eyes or talk to her. Her hair took FIVE HOURS to finish. She was the only client that my mom had that day and was expecting a really big tip. Ivanka didn&#39;t even give her a penny. Hairdressers make money by getting tips, just like being a waiter or waitress. She didn&#39;t make a single dollar that day.

Hairdressers generally work on commission. So even if Ivanka didn't tip her, your mom should have made at least 50% of the price of the bill. And for a 5 hour job, it had to be a chunk of change.

A tip i's just some spare change, and you really do not have to give any tip. For sure, it's never a percent of the bill. Just ask a waiter from a tourist place: Spanish costumers have fame of being stingy.

Raise the wages for the service industry to accommodate the lack of tippers. However, because this is 'murica and total capitalism reigns freely, that wont happen. People in the service industry are told to suck it up after dealing with the guest's toxic behavior, then go home after an 8h+ shift on wages less than standard hourly. In the meantime, companies with delivery services are charging delivery fees that don't even go to the driver whom uses their own car and gas.

I want to shout out my existence, so, If you don't care if someone here on youtube does his real best (and manages to succeed quite often) to create original and nice content, then ignore this comment and move on. Great day to you! *And people, who's attention I’ve managed to capture - "read more" is a way to go.* You might know, that youtube algorithm is a very tough and mean machine, that challenges your ability to work hard and keep frustration inside and I, personally, do my best to beat this challenge. I do not want to be considered as a letsplayer, a guy, who can only talk or any other thing. I'm all of that and I do my best to produce high quality (speaking of information, quality of the footage and editing) content, and, I suppose, I’m doing good so far! (the only problem is my gear) So if you happen to have, maybe, 5 spare minutes, I would like to invite you to my kingdom and appreciate (or not) some of my GENIUS videos.

Ugi0l2axhQsDR3gCoAEC.8Rk2soROBJr8Rnc74oWg4J		0	2017-04-26 01:20:09	Landon Tapscott	DTFaux Neat. Okay, I'll try to make this wall a bit shorter, because I am preoccupied with school and etc etc. I see, North Virginia eh? I'm from central myself, I am aware that Northern Virginia is a bit more urbanized and Liberal-Thinking then most of the rest of the state (Still excluding Charlottesville, Richmond and Roanoke of course). My whole point to the gender Vs sex debate is simple. Gender cannot exist without sex, to say that it's a cultural phenomenon is ridiculous, if gender cannot exist without sex, it proves that words gender and sex are interchangeable. I can agree with you, that people have defiantly had a impact on the world and it's animals. Here's the problem though with what you're arguing. Even with all of the measures already placed on corporations (and the Obama administration has already cracked down severely when it comes to enviromental measures) CO2 levels still grew to irreversible highs. Again, that was determined back in 2011, so as far as Climate Change is concerned, if Climate Change is true then we are already fucked, adding anymore restrictions isn't going to solve the problem. Hell, do you wanna know a real kicker, the United States doesn't even Pollute that much compared to other countries. You wanna know who does though? Middle Eastern Countries (and China). Hell, you wanna argue it to a point of protecting animals, it's estimated that on average that nearly 328,000 birds die yearly from wind turbines, and that nearly 400,000 fish die from hydro-eltric dams, that doesn't sound too good for the Ecosytem now does it? So tell me, what's your energy solution? Convient that it's appropriate to criticize the system when your canidate happens to lose. Again, Rural areas really don't have the upper hand when it comes to the Electoral college though, the amount of Electors is decided by population, and even then, most rural areas still get fucked, because you have urbanized states like New York getting 29 votes in the electoral college, and rural states like Virginia with roughly the same population size only getting 13! On average, the elecortal college is MORE rigged to work for democrats then republicans! Really now? It's so hard for a black or poor person to turn over ANY piece of a simple I.D, that proves they are who they say they are, and I don't one paranoid woman voting twice compares to the 800,000 illegals that were estimated BY a Anti-Trumper (Jesse Richman) to have voted for Clinton. My friend, if the Trump Administration was in fact colluding with the Russian Government, I guarantee you the first people who are gonna be sharpening their pitchforks are former Trump-supporters. What I think you fail to realize though is that under the rule of law, you are innocent until proven guilty, and as far I'm concerned. And you can list all these names you want, but until I have definitive concrete evidence that Trump directly coordinate with Russian officals (and here's the important addition) WITH the intent to manipulate the elections, THEN I will go after him, I'm not picking at straws here. Finally, no, I'm not going for a king, this is the problem with both sides on the political spectrum, both democrats and republicans are so worried about the actual personalities of their presidents instead of what their agendas and etc, that at least I hope we can agree on.

Ugi0l2axhQsDR3gCoAEC.8Rk2soROBJr8RlYezuZXJr		0	2017-04-25 06:02:44	DTFaux Classic	It's all good. I did like the Legend of Korra (and The Last Airbender), but the main reason why I'm rocking this icon is because it's still one of my top favorite expressions in animation. Conversely, about assuming you were talking to a guy, statistically speaking, transgender folks only make up a really small percentage of the population (that we know of so far), so it's not really something to trip over going, "Oh man, I hope I don't transgender them." The ones that you might run into will [hopefully politely] correct you if need be. And by the off-chance that was a slight at me (paranoia, am I right?), I am male in both sex and gender. :V Of course I responded of my own free will. I can't speak for most others, but it has gotten a bit hard to tell the difference between someone who's just joking and someone who's trying to make a point through comedy. I find that quotation marks or ending a comment with an /s helps signal that a comment is not meant to be taken seriously. Not sure if it could've been applied to your original comment though... Arguably, gay being in one's DNA has only been a recently accepted stance. Before that, many assumed they were just going through a phase or that it was a psychological disorder that could be "fixed" with therapy or ousted with religion. But I get what you're saying. I think it's also why, as I mentioned, the trans situation is a bit more complex and complicated than the gay one. I think it might just come down to semantics for those who aren't actively going through a sex change. What if, rather than a guy with a penis saying he's female, what if he accepted that he was male, but felt more feminine [identifying more with how women feel and act over men]? Would that seem more acceptable (or tolerable)? Just because climate change can happen gradually doesn't mean it can't be sped up. Heck, human production, population, consumption, pollution, and waste has never been as high as it has right now, so that could be a change in variables. Granted it's on a different plane, but lands have been destroyed and animals have gone extinct "gradually" thanks to careless human consumption. And it wasn't until someone cared enough to notice and say, "Uh guys? There's only, like 20 of these things left..." to actually try to protect them. Even looking past the warming and cooling of the earth, acid rain and heavy smog was doing damage due to over pollution before sanctions and laws shut that stuff down to improve their respective environments. Coincidentally, I'm actually in the state of Virginia too. The NOVA area, actually (though I hate referring to it like that...). Anyways, there's been arguments that major cities alone don't have the population to decide entire elections or garner most of the candidates times. Texas and Georgia also have some well-populated urban and suburban areas, but the entire state almost always goes red during presidential elections. And I get that our country is a republic, but that doesn't mean we can't criticize the system. The constitution should never be changed willy-nilly, but it has been amended multiple times over the course of history. There's many arguments that could be had against a new amendment, but all that's really needed is enough people/states willing to say, "Sure, let's go for it." It seems like the For Vs. Against EC debate really comes down to how deserving people feel the rural areas should be in having more voting power over everyone having equal voting power and if more densly populated areas really will control the entire thing. To that, all I can say is, let's see if the Republicans and Conservative's tones change if they're ever [un]fortunate enough to win the popular vote but lose the EC. Regarding Voter ID, the stance in favor of voter IDs is to prevent voter fraud (keeping illegals from voting, those using dead constituents' identifications to vote, ballot stuffing, etc). It's not a bad concept in theory, but the concern comes from how complicated some want to make it, giving the perception of trying to restrict voters (mostly poor people or people of color, likely to vote Democrat due to the appeal of government support). Bogging people down with even more bureaucracy and processing fees will keep more from voting. It also doesn't help that there's just not a lot of verifiable cases of voter fraud, except ironically, a female Trump supporter last year who was arrested for trying to vote twice out of fear that her first vote was gonna be changed. There was also the controversy in North Carolina about politicians making it harder for black people to vote in some counties.  I'll agree the Russia allegations are some TV Action/Drama levels of crazy, but again, the case isn't closed yet. Let me ask you this: How would you feel if the tables were turned? Assuming Hillary wasn't your candidate of choice, imagine if your candidate was under fire with Wikileaks and all the Russia allegations were tied to Hillary. Would you still shrug it off? It's not implausible that maybe the Trump administration is trying to take down Assange now so that he doesn't make them their next target, but that is definitely up in the air at the moment. Let's wait and see if they actually go for him and it isn't all talk. Admittedly, "every other week" might be an exaggeration... but so far, we have Paul Manafort (stepped away from the Trump campaign after books were found), Michael Flynn (stepped down after being caught lying about his meetings), Jarred Kushner (met Russian officials, but didn't clarify in hearings), Carter Page (they supposedly tried to recruit him), Rex Tillerson (met with Putin). Ivanka (vacationed with Putin's girlfriend)... Trump himself said he met with Putin. Then denied that he ever met with him. And then there's Trump's tax returns, which I'm sure you're very tired of hearing about. But strange how he's so desperate not to come out ahead of it all. This situation is not unlike him demanding to see Obama's birth certificate. Except Barry showed the goods. The fact that Trump is gonna be hounded until they're produced is so fitting, one might consider it to be karmic or poetic justice. What you've seen about whether Trump has ties or not is in that specter of unknowns. Because the IC isn't going to reveal any classified info to the public unless someone blabs to reporters or the investigation reaches a point where that data can be unclassified. Which could be tomorrow or 8 years from now. To wrap up, there was a quote I've heard related to this situation: "If you go after the king, you best make sure you don't miss." And again, Watergate took two years from Nixon winning the presidency to him resigning. 8 months of investigating could mean we're only nearing the halfway point.

Ugi0l2axhQsDR3gCoAEC.8Rk2soROBJr8Rl-xX7fD-w		0	2017-04-25 00:59:26	Landon Tapscott	DTFaux Sorry, I mistook you as younger given your "Legend of Kora" Profile Pic, just like how I would assume if I were speaking to a man, they would address themselves as a male. True, Comedy is subjective, but you were the one to choose to reply to a joke, I didn't hold a gun to your head and force you to respond to it. You did of your own free will. Admittedly, I didn't put a lot of thought in it, mostly due to the fact that I wasn't expecting anyone to read into it too deeply. You see, the problem that I have with Transgender people that I don't have with gays is that there's an actual scientific reason for why people are gay (like they say, it's in your DNA!) The issue I have with Transgender People is that does not back a Transgender's belief. If you have a penis, then you are a male, if you have a vagina, then you are a female. It's as simple as that. Also, here's why Sex and Gender are complely interchangeable. Male is a term used to describe a person with male genitals, just as female is a term used to describe someone with female gentiles. If nobody had male or female genitals, those words wouldn't exist, and therefore, nobody would have a gender to "identify" as, get what I'm saying? Even by how climate change theories go, that argument doesn't make any sense. Climate Change takes thousands upon thousands of years to occur, and it all happens gradually, it's not something that happens "out of the blue", it occurs gradually. Hell, we are still in a Ice Age for Pete's sake. "There are republican voters in cities and democratic voters in rural areas." That's a complete contradiction to your arguement, you just finished stating that rural areas decided the entire election for Trump. Completely untrue, if you want to see a map of the relationships between urban cities and liberalism, then I highly recommend checking out a county map of last election. On average, the more urbanized a city is, the more they are to vote blue. Hell, I'll even give you an example of this, here in Virginia, Hillary won the entire state, despite only winning 5 counties, these counties contained Richmond, Charlottesville and Virginia Beach. Now imagine that on a larger scale, you wanna talk about canidates only visiting battleground states? Well, with a pure system of democracy, they'll only be hitting up major cities like New York or Atlanta. But hey, fuck all those rural assholes, who gives a shit about them, am I right? Ahem, anyways I'm also starting to think that you're not realizing is that the United States is a Republic. This is just how Republics work, not to mention, EC electors actually aren't really allowed to vote against the canidate who picked them, I mean, they can, but it's illegal and punishable under law, which is why it's not a regular occurrence. Also, I'm not too educated on why voter I.D's are such a big deal, please elaborate on that if you would? Also Jesus the Russia alligations are starting to get a bit ridiculous if you ask me. Oh wow, just because Wiki-Leaks exposed Hillary and not Trump that must mean Trump is working with the russians...or some shit like that. Boi, there is no fundamental proof that Trump has worked with the Russian Government, this even after Trump Towers was survailed, after 8 months of investigation. Yes, Trump must be in bed with Wiki-Leaks, given that they're preparing to arrest Julian Assange. Also, what new Ties betweem the Trump administration, do you know something I don't know? :3 Because so far I've seen jack shit that pins the Trump administration to the russian government.

I've got time to kill and I've also been itching to get some insight to various perspectives (and give some of my own, too). Forgive me in advance if my responses might be essay-like. Especially for the more conceptual subjects. Comedy is subjective. Some jokes are just thrown into the ether, while others do come from somewhere; made to make people think. You, yourself said that it was to "Display the hypocrisy of the left", so you gave it meaning. Perhaps you were going for a, "It's funny because it's true" kind of joke. It didn't register as funny or true to me, which is why I challenged it. Saying it was "said in jest" doesn't negate the subject at hand (it's also kind of a Politically Correct move to downplay being challenged). All that said, maybe someone else would've chuckled at it, so who's to say? Again, comedy is subjective. It's also about timing and delivery. Unfortunately, your honest guess is wrong. I'm College educated (and graduated). Though that doesn't really matter. Some kids can hold their own against adults, and some adults can barely hold a glass of water to a kid. Education is important, but simply graduating doesn't necessarily reflect someone's intelligence. Just the fact that they got good enough grades to "pass". I actually agree about the gay thing. The west is miles more accepting of it than any other part of the world. Which goes into my point about trans folks wanting to be free of being tied to just one of two genders. It's a little different and more complex than guys and girls liking people of the same sex, but most civil rights and social justice movements follow the same trajectory: Once persecuted/hated, many closeted, enough stand up, some fight to keep them down, more people accept it as time goes on until it becomes the norm. I wont act like some folks do act like the ice caps will melt in the next 5 years. Those kind of reactions are definitely exaggerated. I think the bigger concern is the slow, long-term effect, where if things aren't kept an eye on and proper precautions aren't taken early enough, we'll be hit before we realize it. Kind of like that 'Frog in a slowly boiling pot' concept. Perhaps it doesn't need outright urgency, but when people are going on about how it's ALL a hoax, that's just waiting until there is a tangible problem to fix it rather than prevent it. Regarding the election, specifically the EC: The whole "Cities will decide the election" argument doesn't really hold, as there are diverse amounts of voters all across this country. There are Republican voters in cities and there are Democrat voters in rural towns. That level of uncertainty would require candidates to make sure to hit up all four corners of the country and everywhere in between. At least with "Mob Rule", people will have more agency to pick their next president. Compare that to the current system and climate where presidential candidates now just spend time in the "battleground states" now, rather than across the whole nation. They spend less time in the states that toe the party line, as they know they're almost guaranteed the points from those states. This disenfranchises voters who know their vote wont matter within the state because they'll always be outnumbered. This is also ignoring the issue of voter restriction that especially republican states seem to employ (Voter ID laws being a whole other subject for another time). Either way, the EC specifically has electorates that vote on behalf of the people, BUT also have the power to vote against the peoples' will if they deem the choice to be erroneous. They were literally put in the position to be of higher knowledge/thinking than the "average citizen". But thanks to the stranglehold our two-party system has on the government, we're rarely gonna see more than maybe a handful of unfaithfuls every other election. It would be great if more eligible voters DID actually vote. More people SHOULD get involved, invested and educated. Whether or not Hillary would've won if more eligible voters voted is uncertain (Trump could've very well taken the popular vote too in another timeline). What is certain is that of all the people who did vote in the 2016 presidential election, more voted for Hillary. But it's thanks to the EC that Trump just needed enough people in the right places to win instead of the most. People just want the EC rule changed to where majority rules like every other election in our states and country. The electorates would still be fine as insurance. Though, they're pretty useless in the current state. I'll keep the Russia thing equally simple: Of course, there was no findings of ballot tampering or stuffing. But there are lots of reports of [attempted] hacking of officials, fake news articles on social media, trolls posing as American citizens, Wikileaks being weaponized against the DNC and Hillary (but conveniently not against the RNC or Trump?), etc. And yeah, they've been investigating since last July. It also supposedly took the IC two years before they finally came at Nixon about Watergate. Until they specifically say "Case closed", especially when there's apparently a new Russian tie to the Trump campaign every other week and active attempts to hinder/downplay the investigation, I'd be careful out on that limb... Whew! That was a big wall of text! Sorry again about making such a big read. I will admit that I'm bad at keeping things concise. I really wouldn't blame you if you tl;dr'd this whole thing and we just ended the debate now, but if you still have anything, feel free to take your time in responding. This is what debating/discussing is all about~	UCIlA_Yrt-_5xcYrl9mvfdYA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIlA_Yrt-_5xcYrl9mvfdYA	1	Ugi0l2axhQsDR3gCoAEC	Landon Tapscott

First of all, my first statement was not meant to be taken in literal interpretation, in fact, it wasn't even arguement, it was just a joke. A person who would call a comparative joke a Fallacy is interpretating it as a argument. My honest guess that you are more then likely a highschool student who just recently learned what a Fallacy is, and is trying to imply it to humor, hell, you are literally stating a Fallacy by pointing out that just because my joke has a Fallacy in it, the statement is wrong. Second of all, being openly Gay has been more openly accepted in the west then it has ever been in the middle east or far east for that matter. I'm not denying that gays have been openly persecuted in the west, but it is no where near the same degree of what they've faced in the east, Including Africa and Eastern countries, where even today they are still actively hunted and killed brutally. Also, while I do understand that Climate Change has a broader meaning then just Global Warming, the most common point of arguement that Climate Change backers use are that "HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE POLAR ICE CAPS ARE MELTING WE'RE ALL GONNA FUCKING DIE!" When in fact they're not, or at least no where nearly enough of what they exaggerately claim. Now, let's talk about the election, since apparently you need to be reminded that we are not a democracy, we're a Republic which practices certain aspects of Democracy. The United States are nothing more then that, different states that are formed into a Union. Each Vote does count, but only counts for that single state, and weighs in on what canidate that vote goes to. What you are arguing for Pure-Democracy, which in turn gives way to Mob Rule, and Large Cities basically getting to decide the outcome of each election, how is that any more "fair" to you. Hell, maybe to you Hillary won the majority of American People, but how can that be when 2/3's of eligible voters didn't even vote? Now, let's talk about Russia, and I can make this nice and simple, since my fingers are getting tired of typing all these walls! Do we know that Russia attempted to interfere with the elections: Yes. Did that interference actually amount to any tallies being changed: According to DNI, James Clapper, no, not at all. Did the Trump administration coordinate with Russians to actually influence with the elections: Probably not, given that it's been under investigation since last July and the FBI has LITERALLY FOUND JACK SHIT to pin Trump to Russia, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say NO.

Though I'll totally admit to trying to meet snark with snark. Using a joke to make a point between two irrelevant subjects is still a fallacy. If I'm not mistaken, it's the "False Equivalence" fallacy. I could be wrong on the classification, but definitely not the semantic. Anyways... Arguably, transgender (the base of the whole gender debate) is either a new concept or one that is finally getting its voice. That's likely why you're not gonna hear much about it if you try to look towards other countries for leading examples... but give it time. Heck, being openly gay in the west has only recently hit the mainstream (gay marriage in the US being legal across the nation, rather than the state's choice), even though it's apparently been around for ages, and kept in the closet due to religious and moral opposers. And yeah, there have been studies trying to show that climate change doesn't exist. BUT there's more to lose from trying to ignore THAT potential problem than there is worrying about a guy or girl having a preferred pronoun. Also, climate change does regard more than just melting ice caps now (which is why, semantically, "Global Warming" isn't used as much these days). As to why "The left" lost the last election (which has NOTHING to do with the current topic at hand), apparently, you need reminding that Hillary did win the popular vote. Yes, it is the EC that decides things, so one could say she played the game wrong. But it also raises the question about how "fair" the system is when it gives more power to rural areas instead of spreading voting power evenly for everyone. What other countries uses something like the 538 points system to vote their leader in office? But that's a whole other discussion for another time. Oh, and let's not forget about interference by foreign powers to sway public opinion and possible collusion with the currently sitting president and said foreign power... still being investigated, BTW.

Ugi0l2axhQsDR3gCoAEC.8Rk2soROBJr8Rk5RSoFhlz		3	2017-04-24 16:28:07	DTFaux Classic	Those people also distinguish the fact that there's a difference between "gender" and "sex". Sex is the scientific, biological part of it (male and female). Gender is more a cultural and sociological concept that derived from science. Hence the talk about "gender norms", and the want/willingness to break those norms (Blue for boys, pink for girls. Men are tough and gruff, women are soft and sweet. The male hunts and fights, and female cooks and nurtures. etc.). tl;dr - Denying that climate change exists flies in the face of actual science and research. Arguing that there might be more than two genders (not sexes) flies in the face of cultural norms. I'd recommend laying back on the fallacies and try to dig a little deeper in these concepts and ideals. Maybe have some conversations with folks of opposing opinions (without the intention of trying to "win" the argument).

Trump does say and do a lot of things though, so he's essentially a current events generator. As for "wasn't so politically charged?" I mean, the second episode was about the Death Penalty, I'm seeing some episodes about Climate Change, Wealth Gap, Prison, Gender Gap...while it definitely seems to be a little more frequent now, this show has always been political. These are all controversial topics that this show has had a firm opinion on. And given the politically charged climate that we're in right now...iunno, doesn't seem to be particularly out of left field that we'd get a lot of Trump. Though yeah, some more variety would be nice. I'm honestly sick of politics too, but like it or not it's probably here to stay.

They have created a scenario when good things happen, Jared and Ivanka get the credit. A way for after Donald being done they can to throw their hat in the ring for President. Then, they can say I have the experience required and look what we did. I would be impressed if this is their plan since it would be a really good scam and follows up on that excerpt from Ivanka&#39;s book.

Jared Kushner went to(Jews university (Harvard) his tribes own &amp; run) shocking? Kushner is Jew thug, taught by the best (his father REAL Jew white collar criminal. modern day Bugsy Siegel, Meyer Lansky Jewish mobsters(not Italian as Ziowood/Hellywood portrayed). Kushner is Jew York mobster live on 5th avenue building 666. Forbes (Zionist Jews own&amp;run) trash magazine. Mr. Trump, Ivanka, and all Trump&#39;s children must wake up before its too late. (devil)Jews always show his true color. John Oliver(another hook nose UGLY Zionist Jew). Don&#39;t let British accent fool you. (He&#39;s a Jew), just like David Letterman, Jon Stewarts, Larry King(Zeiger), Bill Maher, Howard Stern, Larry David, Sara Silverman, Wolf Isaac Blitzer, Mike,&amp; Chris Wallace trying to save their tribes.

Subsequent use by the child poster showed me my error in so assuming (note: correct use!) and so wrote "shit" in correct spelling. As for "so very" -- it is NOT grammatically incorrect. It is an example of emphasis (as in a "so very, very stupid" comment). Check the OED. An example of its use from OED --"We shall...conclude that.they were not so very young."

The lowest earning families already qualify for ERDC, employment related daycare. There can be a wait for families who haven&#39;t recently received welfare, so that program can be improved, but it exists. Families who are more middle income or low-middle are the one who are the most vulnerable. 40,000-80,000 a year is not enough money to pay for childcare, but you wouldn&#39;t qualify for benefits either. These families have to rely heavily on family and friends to make it work.	UCGulwkohGAqL3JiRlPivKhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGulwkohGAqL3JiRlPivKhw	0

They pay like $20 per kid every day. Of course, they don't go to an actual daycare, they leave their kids with some person. And that person usually has like 4 more kids, she probably doesn't know CPR or first aid, can't speak English, and just gives the kid the food the parents brought and sits them in front of the TV all day.

Slightly less than half the country elected him democratically. You cant ignore millions of people just because you think you are better than them. I love how you tards bust out 'drumpf' like it really hurts my feelings. News flash stupid fuck: I didn't even vote for the guy. I was pro Bernie until after the election when I realized the truth of the situation. You are making enemies out of and alienating your peers. Your group (liberals) is dwindling by the day, I know because I was a prime example. Its was only later that I realized that almost all of the bitching and whining comes from the left.

In all other offices of government, the person with the most votes wins. So, if CA largely decided to vote democrat that's fine because we're looking at all the votes of the nation not a particular state. People are willing to change their minds, imo we don't need this outdated Electoral College. The system does nothing but enforce to people that their vote is meaningless, if their state has more of one party than the one they represent. Some people, even use the previous statement as a reason not to vote.	UClLJ-zYthJ3D4J9G5tL_bMA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLJ-zYthJ3D4J9G5tL_bMA	1	Ugi-FgwYc5dD53gCoAEC	Valtteri Nieminen

Voting in Texas/New york? Texas is basically pure republican, good luck. New York is also mostly democrat so again, your vote is meaningless. E.C. is absolutely worse than a popular vote system in every single way. The vote of the people doesn't matter in the first place considering that "electors" and their election in DECEMBER is what decides the POTUS, even if they suffer big repercussions for not voting for the right person, they still CAN vote for whoever they please.

For example, since the California Senate race was between two Democrats, I'd imagine lots of Republicans didn't even show up to vote, since Hillary would win the state regardless and the main downballot race didn't have a Republican candidate for them to vote for. So I don't think we can know for sure who would have won had the popular vote been the deciding factor.

Not only has the electoral college sided with the losing candidate multiple times throughout electoral history, in this election Clinton won the popular vote by a wider margin than JFK did in 1960.

It's not fair that the state with the highest population has usually voted blue in every election in recent history either, so there's Republicans in California who have the same issue. Regardless, I think the end result wouldn't have mattered. We had two candidates that many thought had too many issues to run. If one had won, the other side would be against everything they do, and the same thing if the other candidate had won.

Ivanka may a well-played distraction and the real alpha and know him in and out and is composed even when saving the buffon playing him like a harp and convince him he did it.I think he might actually be in love with her. That is a person that manipulates well and is seriosly unreal beautiful, like a 10/10 that makes rethink past 10&#39;s as too generous. She&#39;s obviously a cunning succubus but it might better with her there to control the father grew up with concusions very frequently in until huffing made deliberate head trauma obselete.

I don&#39;t affiliate myself with any political party, but when the past few months have been a majority of Trump hate videos it really shows an ulterior motive here.<br /><br />It&#39;s so blatantly pro-democrat that any chance of unbiased comedic journalism is thrown out the window. Where are/were the videos making fun of Hillary? I looked through the uploaded videos and didn&#39;t see a single one (I could&#39;ve just missed it; correct me if I&#39;m wrong).<br /><br />Like I said, I&#39;m not writing this because I&#39;m a Trump supporter.

Be it figuratively, they are destructive because they must control the narrative. If a person is compelled to manipulate and control the story, then why do we, the people, find the person so trustworthy? Simple. We ourselves are just as corrupt and manipulative. It&#39;s the residue of hopelessness. Ivanka even stated that creating or using a story that suits your own interest is ok. Yet we admonish our children for being in such a way, yet rationalize the behavior in leaders.These people are destructively Machiavellian. As soon as they don&#39;t get their way, they will draw up the bridge and fill the moats will oil. Peasants be warned. <br /><br />Ivanka&#39;s statement was the most telling. And yet, nearly every supporter will simply say, &quot;Isn&#39;t she pretty and smart.&quot; The emotional simplicity of the mid-west is the life-blood of the Trumps. Trump and Trumpettes could not bare the weight of intelligent discourse.	UC5LBPM_OeopufBgpu1kSIUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5LBPM_OeopufBgpu1kSIUA	0

We get it, you don&#39;t like the guy and he makes seriously questionable decisions. There is so much more going on in the world than Trump. Even last week&#39;s &quot;French Election&quot; coverage had a not so subtle callback to Trump. It&#39;s really getting old.

This guy has daughters, sons, sons-in-law and that weird lady in Trump Tower NYC, all claiming close ties and selling their positions to the easiest bidder.

I hardly see how the age of an empire, whose democratic urges were frequently cannibalized by aristocratic coups, serves as a model for own? As for those mentioning RFK. There was undoubted nepotism there. However RFK had acted as counsel in huge cases in Washington and served on numerous political committees. From the perspective of his relationship to the president, his role was problematic. However he was qualified for his official position. Which is the opposite of the case for Kushner as is Oliver's point.	UCeZVWSjq-NkJIQG3nVDd3_g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZVWSjq-NkJIQG3nVDd3_g	1	UghfB1Z_xTkl_ngCoAEC	Jonny smithy

UgjwaO0O3iQFUXgCoAEC	2	80	2017-04-24 14:38:51	David Z	I don&#39;t think this is complicated. Trump doesn&#39;t know shit about being president, but he can&#39;t let that show. He clearly doesn&#39;t have the time or desire (maybe even capacity) to try to understand the nuances of 50 (arbitrary number) different position and all possible candidates for them and then have to communicate with 50 different people about said 50 nuanced conversation that they entail, all of which would undoubtedly find out Trump doesn&#39;t know shit and could threaten to blow the whistle... So whats a big clever orange orangutan to do? Just appoint the one guy who screws your daughter to all 50 positions to bullshit their way through it (just like you&#39;re bullshiting through the presidency) so you only have to communicate to one person who you already have by the balls and can dismiss and if anything goes wrong, they can take the blame. I&#39;d compliment Trump for this if he wasn&#39;t so damn stupid in every other regard.	UCa3oV97AM-11tCspcmHzrxw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa3oV97AM-11tCspcmHzrxw	0

Apparently "opening back up the coal mines" is "helping everyone" LOL. Those coal miners get the short straw every single time. Large corporations have hugely profited off of their labors for decades and they receive fucking breadcrumbs and serious health issues (the black lung) in response. Instead of finding alternative, higher paying, and healthier work for these rural communities, Trump opens back up the coal mines so the unemployment rate will go down and he can seem like he is doing something right because, as we all know, he is fucking up this presidency in more than a few ways. These rural communities have so many problems, and instead of trying to fix them, Trump just decides to open up the coal mines so the coal companies can start gaining power once again and so they will begin to pollute these same communities' water and poison them in response. One of the biggest problems in these communities is opiod dependency, but I'm sure Jared Kushner will fix that by himself no problem. These communities will just keep getting perpetually shit on thanks to people like you who advocate that "Trump is looking out for them" because the unemployment rate is down.

And it may be the best way to present information that won’t get fact checked. He could have had data about that area being highly blue collar area where ‘strong hands’ were a thing. He could have had data about that area being very much against screens. He could have had info about that area being financially conservative and wanting politicians to be more financially conservative. So yeah. Some of the weird rambling that people think is trump getting off topic is him just trying to jam in all of the talking points that will appeal to the particular demographic he is addressing. He had notes saying ‘I hear you’ as a talking point.

The &quot;golden child&quot; has to become mentally and verbally limber enough to keep any of the disordered parents from exploding. She becomes an expert negotiator, poised, confident under pressure, and able to communicate completely opposite things to different people, because the goal is to keep both parents happy. <br /><br />The problem is that she doesn&#39;t develop any sense of self apart from the disordered parents. Without intervention, that can pass on the disorder to the next generation. :(	UCOcUPeyXud2MRXlPWmUcrgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOcUPeyXud2MRXlPWmUcrgA	0

Mechanical engineers build things that move like robotics or industrial equipment. The correct term is &quot;structurally engineered&quot; because architects, architectural engineers, and civil/structural engineers design and build (engineer) structures.<br />Also, &quot;structurally engineered&quot; implies that the the people who designed and built the building have some kind of backbone or purpose behind their actions.

Also, this excessive patriotic group of people who followed him and voted for him has to at least think about what does being patriotic mean... since its being nearly confirmed that there is a connection on the presidential election being tainted by Russia.

UgguBXazUPFVnXgCoAEC	6	2	2017-04-24 13:35:55	DAS BOOTZ	I think I finally figured out why John Oliver&#39;s comedy style always seemed a bit <b>off</b>. It&#39;s that he hits the joke/punchline TWICE. He&#39;ll make the joke and hit the punchline......then hit it again. The 2nd (and sometimes 3rd) punch actually HURTS the joke rather than builds it (which is what he seems to be going for). <br />EX-- <b>funny clip about healthcare</b>, John-&quot;OH COME ON! YA KILLING ME......Literally!&quot;, joke lands, people laugh, cuts off laughter to say &quot;LITERALLY, COME ON!, laughter is far lighter since he cut it off so he says punchline again, he tries one more &quot; LITERALLY!!&quot;, laughter has died and punchline now feels forced. <br /><br />Its really weird for a professional comedian to be making such amateurish mistakes.

In this video at 12:36-12:43 there a funny clip, a laugh, then he cuts off the laughter to add a punchline, much less laughter since he cut it off, replays joke clip, much less laughter, does the punchline AGAIN, laughter is pretty much dead. It's clear that he's trying to build off the momentum of the first joke to boost the punchline/2nd joke and make the total funnier but instead he's killing all momentum and the jokes fall flat.

I am also disappointed that the John Oliver team decided to attack someone in such a way. Not everyone has beach bodies, so the body shaming is a bit embarrassing, unsettling, and ... petty?

Trump likes new &amp; strong personalities, but only for a &#39;minute&#39; &amp; not if that person receives too much attention. Ivanka is Trump&#39;s daughter &amp; she looks good, like an accessory. Jarod is Trump&#39;s mirror, by not speaking Trump simply assumes Jarod agrees with him. Both are most likely rather &#39;bland&#39; around Trump... I thought Jarod &amp; Ivanka were &#39;so much more&#39; in the beginning, now, I just think they are not anything at all... Otherwise, Trump would simply bury them with the &#39;others&#39; that tried to steal his &#39;ratings&#39;... Trump still thinks this Presidency is a reality show. Most likely, he has mentally adjusted his reality to suit him, in order to deal... Trump is ill... He is not mentally normal nor competent &amp; no amount of discussion will change that fact...

My home country has a female leader & female opposition in 2 other main parties' leaders, including one who is gay - I learned that from the NYT, 6 months *after* our own elections! When in the US, I am aware of the difference... ) - but I would entirely agree with you on that point. I understand the need to say 'I don't mean to be sexist' - because in some circumstances, it could be a sexist comment. I think it is purely branding & it is comparable to selling (fresh from an article I read earlier today) yoga wear - 'modelled' by skinny, (lean) muscular bodies, not obese women (in specific example) doing yoga in leggings & a crop top. With that other example fresh my head, the 'hating' from the 'skinny girls' commenting in response to an obese yoga instructor is the simplest, most obvious example of the entire concept of branding. She is pretty, in a very conventional, polished, wealthy way; very (very ... to the nth!) composed, speaks very deliberately, with preparedness and is *always* in that public persona. Arguably as diametrically opposite to her father as possible - superficially, anyway. Genuinely, who knows? I think it appears very obvious (for anyone choosing to look deeper) that she is something of a construct. Who actually knows what is true and if she even has a strong, dominant/ 'strong female' (not to be sexist 😉); or even feminist personality or not - I don't think she ever presents *herself* - just the part she plays.

Because look at the Trump boys (excluding Barron). They sure dont get the same benefit of the doubt or free passes as Ivanka does despite also supposedly being Trump's "moral compass".

When you say Ivanka or Invanka Trump it brings with it the idea/historical context of Donald Trump. Then, cognitively, people compare the two and the obvious answer is that Ivanka is considered moderate when compared to her father. Granted the majority of people will tend to be more moderate when compared to Donald.	UCnM4V-91CtVSqfpkr609tzQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnM4V-91CtVSqfpkr609tzQ	1	UggcSgh1JxbRFngCoAEC	domdawn94

Look at how easy it is for someone like that to just completely suck the oxygen out of a conversation. Everybody just fixates on the idiotic thing the troll said, and nothing is intelligible or cohesive anymore. And the only effort that's really required is some programmer designing a bot to feed through youtube comments and spit out a preprogrammed line. This is essentially what the russian hacking scandal during the election last fall boiled down to.

The majority of people do not agree with either extreme of the spectre in most issues, in politics that would be libertarians and communists.

Nothing in this world is really black and white and we shouldn't really treat it as such, especially when it comes to decisions that effect an entire nation. No one's asking for things to be firmly in the middle of course, otherwise nothing gets done (like congress) and there is certain to be some leaning when it comes to decision making, but the end result should always involve comprimise. For whatever reason people have gotten kinda tired of the whole "compromise" thing, and now we've delegated ourselves to clutching out pearls and yelling at each other from opposite sides of the room.

The issue I have is that he used to at least talk about things not directly related to the presidency, now we're lucky to have a main segment that isn't just Trump bashing. It just feels like he found a topic that gets him more viewership so he harps on it and pretends that his side is without fault, when he used to be the best source for unearthing deep rooted issues that no one talks about. Now he just talks about the same things CNN and the NY Times talk about so alt left viewers. It just seems pandering at this point. I've lost respect for him and losing my interest in the show. I personally am a Libertarian (which sucks bc Libertarian candidates tends to be awful), so I don't have much beef in either side's success.

The only time people praise him, and even John points these out when Trump and the people around him actually act like normal people and not literal children with way too much power and money. There's no point going "neutral" when there's absolutely nothing to gain from that.	UCT-uYfLgbd3bciFcRZID9VQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT-uYfLgbd3bciFcRZID9VQ	1	UghPTFZRgUWLB3gCoAEC	Crazelord91

All I'm saying is that it's increasingly getting harder to tale John seriously when he wears his bias on his sleeve.

I personally worry about many things he's doing and agree with John a lot. But I noticed that even pre-trump John never had a bad thing to say about Obama, but I didn't really notice his bias until this election. My issue is not that he hates Trump, it's more that his credibility is hurt by never being able to find fault with democrats, which just shows he panders to a specific audience for views instead of being the unbiased commentator "non journalist" he portrays himself as	UCLFqgPVS_RpabXq225LxW2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLFqgPVS_RpabXq225LxW2Q	1	UghPTFZRgUWLB3gCoAEC	Crazelord91

We get it, people don't like Trump and he's an idiot. 90% of the time it's something in the real of "look at how wired this wording is lolololol". Yeah, Trump is terrible at... well talking in general it seems but we got that joke during the month and month of pre-election coverage. It of course doesn't help that in many cases it's the least charitable interpretation that hits the big news and forces people to defend Trump because it's simply bullshit, not because they actually like Trump. This Hitler and chemical weapons thing is a prime example of that. Doesn't matter were you go, Trump memes, Trump news, Trump this, Trump that. At this point there is no joke that hasn't been made 100 times. The Trump incest joke came up again in this video and has been done to death in this and other late night shows.

You have a big loss in one field and suddenly people regard you as more talented in unrelated fields. Some of his fellow scientists have also quietly grumbled that he wouldn't be such a super star if he didn't have a disease, but since they probably agree he deserves a break and know Stephen didn't ask for it, they don't make a big issue out of it. So this is just a long-winded way of saying that people judge on superficial qualities. We project good qualities onto attractive people, and negative qualities on unattractive people, but the "blind oracle" phenomenon also exists for disabled or severely disfigured individuals.

Let&#39;s look at contrary evidence: Jared&#39;s business (which he hasn&#39;t divested himself of, any more than Trumpie has) being sued for inaction on rat infestation, and remember: real estate is his primary qualification. Ivanka was being touted as moderating influence, with her Dad&#39;s ear, when Conway dropped her blatantly corrupt &quot;Buy Ivanka&quot; bombshell. Did Ivanka protest, or even contest that? No, but she provided a distraction, with her $ 10 (annually!) child-care subsidy idea, which still lacks implementation. Rampantly venal, unscrupulous nepotism!

They cannot burn books, because people can get them on kindle, but destroying something taken for granted like PBS, they will block one of the few windows poor people have of watching what else is out there. Like watching Julia Childs or Placido Domingo could inspire somebody to be a chef or an opera singer. Lin Manuel Miranda said he got his love for musicals after watching INTO THE WOODS on PBS.

On the back of "The Republic" by Plato it says the Western world is based on the book. If that is the case, our education is subpar and should be standardized being equally available to all. Therefore, the majority of Americans have an underdeveloped intellect not allowing their reason to overpower impulse and their spirit.

Not to mention the fact that John Oliver&#39;s apolitical jokes are also awful. I mean, this guy&#39;s comedy career was a complete failure in Britain. I guess liberals watch him because he bashes Republicans. Stephen Colbert does the same thing, but at least he&#39;s funny at times. Repeating that it&#39;s the &quot;current year&quot; over and over gets old, fast.	UC3e3BRqt9L7F9NhzjKJlKOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3e3BRqt9L7F9NhzjKJlKOg	0

It's okay if he thinks she's a beautiful woman. Most dads think that of their daughters, and that's okay, but normal dads don't call their daughters sexy and don't want to sleep with them (or date them!). They'd say something like, "Look what a beautiful woman my daughter has grown into. Those are my genes! :)" and pat themselves on the back for having a hand in making such a beautiful work of art. And that would be the extent of it. And that *should* be the extent of it. Anything more and there's something just not right about that particular parent-child relationship...

The rest of the segment is mostly speculation and nitpicking, which doesn&#39;t really add or subtract anything and more than anything resembles the &quot;normal journalism&quot; that he&#39;s normally so good at deflating. Of course it highlights that not much is known about these people, but by going out of your way to find ridiculing examples about others, you risk being perceived as a bit petty and narrowminded yourself, and not all that factual and objective - and yeah I said perceived, so it&#39;s all good.<br />He might be right, and he might be wrong - this one only time will tell I guess. Plus all that is said about these two, is said relatively to this guy called Donald Trump, so let&#39;s not burn them on the stake but in stead remember that something made a whole lot of ppl vote for Trump to begin with	UCnqjDqT3sAu7AoSk2mu0pSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnqjDqT3sAu7AoSk2mu0pSg	0

UgghWKukwEYUmHgCoAEC.8RjVOgt2z8j8Rk11mNl5og		17	2017-04-24 15:49:39	Claystead	+Michael Edwards I went to Cambridge as well as a "normal" college (I have two degrees), and can confirmed these glorified country clubs are not worth the cost compared to normal college. The difference in quality of education is simply not worth paying six or seven times more. We are talking marginally more available professors and writing support, as well as more electronic source material and broader journal access. However, you could buy those things yourself for a quarter of the price difference. According to my friends in the States, Berkeley costs almost as much and gives you even less than Cambridge. These schools are at their core ripping you off for their "brand," a brand which is essentially worthless in the job market besides for certain narrow fields, like education, law, and IT. The ROI is just not worth it, unless you are getting a BA, BS or BE and sticking with that. The subject of your postgraduate theses are endlessly more useful for getting jobs. For example, my current job as a researcher goes off my degree out of the University of Oslo, not my degree out of Cambridge. Why? Because expertise in genocide investigation is far more employable than expertise in the workings of international aid organizations and NGO's. You wouldn't think so, but the simple fact of the matter is that NGO's primarily recruit outside the PoliSci scene, in order to reflect their mission statement or simply to get a certain non-academic viewpoint. On the other hand, genocides keep happening, and the EU, the UN, OSCE and dozens of other international organizations need investigators. In other words, expertise counts more for employability than brand.	UCJUsOVXLtcNQz8EgtWaaXrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJUsOVXLtcNQz8EgtWaaXrg	1	UgghWKukwEYUmHgCoAEC	JuL3r

The only way that could remotely be possible for someone is if they've had sex with them or thought about it alllll the time. I'm a father and I would NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS give that as an answer. In fact I have an application for dating my teenage daughter and on it one of the questions is, "what are the first thee things that comes to your mind when thinking about my daughter?" If any of them start with T, S, or A go ahead and start running in a serpentine fashion. I'm effective at 600 yards." It's oviously a joke question but I don't even what other guys thinking about sex when it comes to my daughter why would I? Trump is sick and supporting him just because he has an (R) by his name is sick. Unless you live in Russia or are paid by Palmer Luckey then I understand.

They hate that their citizens have universal access to health, they hate that women have access to their rights that range from reproductive rights to economic. They also hate and discredit science and diversity. And this just to name a few things that directly affect the citizens of the United States. And with respect to the rest of the world they hate everything that is not white, heterosexual, Christian and has money	UCx9jLI_1zjjaET8vyts-WfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9jLI_1zjjaET8vyts-WfQ	1	UgittGaWKj7nzHgCoAEC	D3g0nGirl

I&#39;d think it was inappropriate if our president spoke that way in interviews about our first lady, let alone his own daughter. And the worst part is that he says these things premeditated on NATIONAL TELEVISION, like it means nothing! But because Trump is so crazy, it&#39;s like somehow not a big deal that he says this stuff because, compared to everything else that he says and does, it&#39;s kind of toned down. And this has been happening recently too, even during his campaign. Not just 10 years ago, so there&#39;s no excusing it because &quot;he was young and dumb back then&quot; when he was in his 60&#39;s. You&#39;d think he&#39;d be aware of, or at least be MADE aware of, how inappropriate it is. How messed up can he be that he doesn&#39;t understand that the way he speaks about his daughter makes people very uncomfortable?

See, Jared and his brother Josh have a company, along with another partner from Blackstone. It&#39;s called Cadre. And it got its start from a sizable $250 Million credit line from Soros Fund Management. You think he&#39;s in his newly found position by accident? In fact, do you think he just randomly found Ivanka and fell in love with her and got married?<br /><br />He&#39;s not a saint, he&#39;s controlled... ergo, Trump is controlled by him.

Unless you have a rich family who can bribe the school, you don't get to get into an Ivy League school with poor grades. Furthermore Harvard generally accepted a little over 10% blacks into their school and like 25% Asians and even more whites. Whites still make up the vast majority of their demographics, so when you say that they're screwed over I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Blacks are a small percentage of the people who get accepted tons of other races get in just fine. So if you were denied to your dream school, I suggest you just hit the books a little bit harder.

The quest for "constant diversity" inherently requires systemic racism and double standards. Oddly, we see none of the same applied to black dominated fields in the country, e.g. professional sports. Ironically, liberalism professes to believe in equality. Nothing could be further from the truth in 2017.

Whites are the majority population granted schools set aside a certain quota that needs to be met for accepting minorities but they're in competition with not only eachother but the standards of the institution.... Whites are ignorant for the most part they never see the truth because they would rather be a victim Breakdown of their schools they are the Majority they aren't upset at the rich white kid who's parents pay to get them in the athletes who supersede them the poor whites who get in who have outstanding grades nope they say omg I didn't get in because of minorities the small percentage who were accepted Let's not discuss scholarships whites take majority of those too I believe with maybe 10% going to minorities so no this affirmative action shit is blown way out of proportion lowering acceptance standards for one group and not the other in any institution will lower your rating So they have to meet the same standards as everyone else I got into the private college I am in not because I am black but because I have a 3.6 GPA and a Veteran basically I had to buss my ass to goto school and get where I am and I'm a black female there is no oh let me not fail her because she's black That's bullshit I get jobs because I am a veteran as well but before the military I didn't get a lot because I was black and until someone tells you you're over qualified and hires a white felon over you who has no criminal record then you can speak on what affirmative action really is Obviously it's not working at lower levels than state or government 100%	UCnqZw67D-OOZiznmEQEoZeg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnqZw67D-OOZiznmEQEoZeg	1	Uggn09tFiyx8jXgCoAEC	amanda miller

I see Pro-Trump and Anti-Trump individuals arguing over what is currently happening. The problem is these arguments inevitably devolve into shouting and insult matched over what the Clintons and Obama did in the past. None of that matters. What matters is what is happening at this time in the United States Government under the Trump Administration. Party affiliations should not be factored into questions or morality and ethics. Nor should what others have done in the past or what others may have done in some hypothetical alternate timeline. Theoretical wrongs and wrongs of the past should not be used to justify actual wrongs in the present. I am neither Republican nor Democrat. I do not affiliate myself with any political party. I vote my conscience.	UCTpiZxvcI9WSw2431E1yuyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTpiZxvcI9WSw2431E1yuyg	1	UghoTeDCZk6bjXgCoAEC	Laura Tirier

I don't even like the guy, but I have a little historical perspective on the matter and I'm trying to be fair about it. Prior to the 1970's, it was quite common for US Presidents to give close family members very minor secretarial/assistant positions in the administration. Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower both did it, as well as many presidents before them. The problem came when JFK appointed his little brother Bobby to the head of the U.S. Dept. of Justice, which directly led to the 1967 federal anti-nepotism law. Trump cleared the appointment with the previous admins DOJ, and I honestly see the reasoning behind the ruling. As long as the positions grant Ivanka and Jared no power in an official capacity and no pay, I don't really give a shit. These jobs are nothing more than glorified resume fillers. Also, I never said that payment was the defining criteria of nepotism. I was just making a point as to how miniscule these positions are. I don't give give two shits what John Oliver says, Jared Kushner has zero power in an official capacity. Does he have a large amount of influence over Trump? Yes, but that has nothing to with his official position. Trump could ask for advice from Jared anytime regardless of whether or not he has this position, and that was part of the DOJ's reasoning in allowing the appointment.

And maybe you can be pretty moderate in the local government, but up top you typically have to be toward one end of the spectrum or the other to get your party to keep you. It all works out to leave us with politicians who are typically disconnected from the reality of the situation and are overly corrupt. Either that or they just pander to what the masses want instead of being proactive about things. On top of all that,I doubt there are too many other democratic-type countries where so many people are against the government stepping in to help people with basic human needs like healthcare and food. In the end, beyond calling our congressman or starting a useless petition, there isn't a hell of a lot the American people can do about this crazy shit.

Which is to say if it's convenient to say some nice things he will, if it's inconvenient to help out he won't but ultimately we don't matter to him. Which would actually be a fine and even preferable position for all non-LGBT people to take if they all took it at once but not something he gets credit for given that he appointed Mike Pence and will probably not oppose any anti-LGBT abuses by the state and has only ever really supported LGBT people as a means to take a stance against Islam and even then in the most moderate way possible.

Over half of Americans want Trump impeached, so why hasn't he been impeached? Because it's the job of the Speaker of the House to file articles of impeachment, and the Speaker is Paul Ryan, who is not only using Trump to further his own agenda of austerity, but actually saw a 29-point drop in his own polls when he criticized Trump.

She used a WH Spokesman to pander her goods (which got her a metric fuckton of free coverage from the shitstorm that followed). Whereas Hillary has given more to the CGI then she ever got, and for all the foibles of CGI, it helped to dramatically reduce the HIV epidemic in Africa, provided relief for Fukushima and a deadly tsunami in SE Asia, partnered with the Gates foundation to further distribute protections from deadly Malaria, poured money into Haiti (which actually was well run, no matter how much a few Duvalier exiles lie about it) and New Orleans post-Katrina. Concerns about Hillary's ethics involving donation gathering are justified, if hyperbolic, but CGI was truly a charity, and all Ivanka's done is plunder.

Ivanka doesn't have as much real power in politics than Clinton had, instead Ivanka has connections. Sure she has access to those connections because of her father but that doesn't make her crooked because Ivanka isn't holding a publicly elected office and she didn't use that trust against the voters. No one voted her in to work for them. If anything this just says that the Trump family is slimy and greedy. It doesn't say that she is crooked.

To look back at the founding fathers, though, they designed the constitution as a living document because they knew that it wasn't perfect, and that even if it had been at the time, times change and new laws must be introduced to keep balance and account for new threats. To not view possible nepotism as a threat would be a grave mistake.	UCpOHqYWTQYKunNUN2UGHWXg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpOHqYWTQYKunNUN2UGHWXg	1	UgicKrjrC1XncHgCoAEC	SAHM

There's a big grey area about the subject, and Ivanka and Kushner are in the middle of it and not technically violating any laws, because they aren't being paid. The problem is, they're being paid in power and influence, presiding over things that they can profit from. The president can't just appoint anyone he wants. Also, I don't claim to know what the founding fathers thought of nepotism, but seeing as they JUST ESCAPED BRITISH MONARCHY, where a family held each other in power, they probably didn't believe that nepotism can be "good".

UgicKrjrC1XncHgCoAEC.8RjDZWZwfN08RjqF3ESmaK		4	2017-04-24 14:06:36	Joe L	It is not. The president can basically appoint anyone he wants. The idea is if the voters don't like it they will vote him out next term. Really there should not be laws limiting this. The president should have the freedom to choose who he wants to work with. It was really obvious throughout the election that Trumps family and businesses would be the biggest benefactors of his election. If you read some of the history of the Constitution there is a good deal about this type of stuff. The founding fathers did not necessarily see nepotism as bad. They believed that it could actually be good. What they thought was worse was not allowing a 'common' man to run for office. Basically the founding fathers would take way more issue with the cost of elections than nepotism.

Did they miss the Hamilton hype, and not hear the lines uttered by Aaron Burr &quot;talk less, smile more&quot;? Hamilton was the one who was decisive and actually had thoughts and spoke out. Burr just smiled because it would make him seem more agreeable, which is probably what kushner is doing. Kushner&#39;s even worse than Burr; at least Burr was decisive enough to pull the trigger.

If experience and qualifications are all that you look for in a leader, then Le Pen is infinitely more qualified than Marcon, yet you spent the episode on the french election pushing the totally unqualified Marcon over Le Pen for ideological reasons. Thats ok, but it just seems a little two faced when suddenly qualifications dont matter why you like the guy. <br /><br />But as to Jareds skills and abilities. He did graduate Cum Laude from Harvard, which unless he also bought his grades is rather impressive. He turned a $20m profit while investing in real estate while earning those honor as a college student. That does speak well of him as a businessman. And its easy to knock the deal he made in 07 as a bad one, yet I can think of something that happen that year which may have effected real estate prices. The New York Observer more than quadrupled its viewership and is now profitable. He also got his degree in government. <br /><br />I am not saying that he is perfect for the million jobs that has for some reason. But if you wanted to make him look absolutely brilliant, you easily could have. You end this segment with &quot;This isnt an attack on them&quot; yea well it really is. You started your research with a vested interest in making them look bad, and selectively applied data points to support a preconceived notion. Thats not journalism, thats propaganda. Frankly, you owe your fans more than you gave them this weak. You are better than this Jon.	UChY1T5huvhON-NbDq-7LW_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChY1T5huvhON-NbDq-7LW_w	0

So many people just go around with nothing but assumptions and almost no solid basis for those assumptions. <br /><br />You go with the facts at hand, not what you like to think is true. The fact is she&#39;s a Trump and she supports her dad. No amount of appeal on her part will ever change that. I know she&#39;s pretty and smart, but it&#39;s her dad who&#39;s president and that&#39;s who you should really look at.

At every stage, He WANTED people to know it was Him throwing down hoards of locusts, turning people into pillars of salt, opening up the ground to swallow entire families, striking people down en masse with disease, claiming firstborn sons, and flooding the planet. He WANTED people to know it was Him, so all of us idiots down here would know He was serious. That He was not fucking around, and we should pay fucking attention.<br /><br />And then we have the New Testament, where He lets us murder Him, in order to give us a blank check on all our wrongdoings and an express ticket to heaven, so long as we ask for it. Basically, the Bible is the story of God playing both bad cop and good cop.	UCSsYKNxFvk2ddmq9L5YPucQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSsYKNxFvk2ddmq9L5YPucQ	0

If all you idiots would get off your fucking high horse, you'd realize that almost no one gives a shit about climate change, even people who are aware of it. Do you see people heading out in mass to spread awareness or force the government to effect the right changes? People who believe in it when asked vastly outweigh those that don't, if they actually gave half as much of a shit about it as they all claimed, it would be a matter of course that something would be done about it. But no, it's just something that doesn't directly effect most people, so they don't actually give a damn, they just whine about to feel enlightened, while people from other countries who are just as bad or MUCH WORSE blame America like they're supposed to be the worlds savior. You know why I'm not all that upset Trumps in office? Because maybe it'll drive home after four years that the rest of the world needs to GET OFF ITS ASS and DO SOMETHING. And that includes here in America and elsewhere. As it is, you're just using it as a bullet against more conservative right wingers. Furthermore most people who call people who don't believe in it idiots when THEY don't even know the science behind it. They've never even thought to look at the studies.

Even if he gets impeached, which is looking less likely every day, the proceedings would have only begun if the Dems can retake Congress in 2018. That means we&#39;re looking at at least 2 years of Trump presidency before we can even start.<br /><br />If Jared and Ivanka are the only way you can sleep at night, good.

His sardonic exposure of politicians and world leaders is always supported with data and facts in which he then bounces an opinion off of... FOX News does the exact reverse. Not that CNN or MSNBC is any better. Watching Last Week Tonight allows me to laugh so that I might keep from crying.

Actually i'm sure you don't have enough of a attention span to do so, therefore i'll help you just watch from here: 21:06 . Then note this phrase: "this all seems like an evisceration of both Jared and Ivanka, but it is *really NOT* . I don't know enough about them to eviscerate them, just as you don't know enough to put any real hope in them." Now go back to your C.o.D.

Now that you mention it though, compare the amount of murders by stabbing in the UK to America per capita, should the UK ban knives also? Lol. BTW I checked your statistics on abortions and it's even worse than I thought. Only 7% of women get an abortion because of health problems to her, to the child, or rape.

Over the years we have seen police kill children, unarmed civilians that are on the floor or have their hands up, or innocent bystanders and you may say it's just a few bad apples but as the saying goes a few bad apples spoils the bunch. And several cities have filed complained due to excessive force http://graphs.net/police-brutality-statistics.html Yes majority of abortion are not caused by incest, rape, or illnesses but around 43% are they others are because of financial problems or they're underage. The total taking these into a count is around 73% leaving only 23% of abortions takes just cause they don't want a child http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html And most doctors think is should be legal it was around 57% http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/5-facts-about-abortion/ Yes those guns are attained illegally that's why we need gun control and reform and listen no one is asking to take away your guns they want simple reform such as background checks and a registry. And on your bullshit claim that more guns cause less violence let's take the UK for example. Per Capa the amount of deaths in the UK as a result of gun violence is around 1 out of 100,000 people in the US it's 10× that (10 out of 100,000) the US is also the country with the most gun death per capa http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/ Took me about 1:30 to do this man 	UC_i39AWNrRCTDKgE-7pFEyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_i39AWNrRCTDKgE-7pFEyw	1	UghNaEL7ZzRhDHgCoAEC	I C Clouds

The country I come from had an oppressive dictator who was eventually assassinated by the people in the 1960s. This is the sole purpose and entire reason for why the 2nd amendment exists. BTW as far as dictators go, I have never read about any dictator that didn't outright ban guns or place severe restrictions on them. There is no state interest (for America) in wanting to help Syrian refugees and yet liberals want to do everything to let them into the country. So abortions = no state interest yet foreign refugees do? Liberal hypocrisy, which is my entire point. Whether you want to accept it or not you pick and choose views that are incompatible and hypocritical on principle in order for it to line up with your chosen ideology. This happens on both sides of the political spectrum but it is particularly obvious among liberals. BTW I'm not a religious person at all, it's dumb to assume that to be against abortions you automatically have to be religious.

Municipal judges? Without independent review, it's impossible to truly determine things. Regardless of the reasons for an abortion, you have no moral stake in it and neither does the state. The fetus has no rights, there's no prevailing state interest - we're certainly overpopulating the planet fast enough. You're interjecting in somebody else's personal moral choice. If I don't care about your opinion, or your BS God's opinion, why would I care about a doctor's moral opinion? Doctors don't make the claim that the practice is unsafe, because they know D&C has been used for nearly a century, and if performed in a sterile environment, is minimally invasive, has a low chance of complications (<1%, <0.03% requiring in-patient treatment)), and is far safer than even Cesarean Section (You're seven times more likely to die from a c-section under the same circumstances) delivery. As for their moral opinion, I don't care. I'm not sure which particular dictator you're talking about, but since there's been thousands of dictators throughout history, they have an incredibly low percentage of being removed from office by death, and there's no reported case of a dictator having ever been ousted by an armed civilian population as opposed to a military, I'm not entirely sure what your point is beyond "Dictators kill people, yo." As for our debate style, you've shown no interest in an actual debate - the closest you've come to a fact is "Some doctors think abortion is bad" and "Fetuses have DNA in them" - a sort of banal moral pandering, without any concern for the morality of what you're advocating. I fully understand that the difference between a late-term abortion and infanticide is more semantic than fact, but I can't have that level of granular discussion with somebody like you, because you're neither capable nor willing to admit that your opposition may have a point, and that you might have to respect their rights and desires too. Until then, I might as well beat you down until I get bored.	UCY_YRqqhJHhpcjL4S1AeSXQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY_YRqqhJHhpcjL4S1AeSXQ	1	UghNaEL7ZzRhDHgCoAEC	I C Clouds

So what an individual perceives as wrong or right should always take precedence over others? So if I owned some land and put in it the world's most polluting factory, it doesn't matter that it hurts others as long as I feel it lines up with my morals? So the government can force me to accept someone not of my biological sex in a public restroom even though it does not line up with my moral compass? Liberals pick and choose when to be authoritarian and when to be for individual rights whenever it suits their agenda. It's not about me being retarded and more about pointing out the hypocrisies in the ideology.

Most abortions are not because of rape, incest, or illness, unless the illness is pure convenience. Many doctors have spoken against abortion including many who used to perform abortions themselves. Gun violence may have caused 1 million deaths but most have been from ILLEGALLY obtained guns, and those deaths pale in comparison to the millions of who have died when a dictator rose to power and banned civilian ownership of guns to forcefully retain power. Your whole argument style illustrates my entire point about most liberals. The self perceived elitism and virtuosity.

Gender is a social and cultural concept - it's how we perceive sex, what roles we apply, what biases and preferences we attribute. Since what being a "man" has differed from culture to culture throughout time (being male, who's only characteristics are sexual organs and related chromosomes. remains unchanged) - there's no reason it can't increase or decrease scope. As for the latter, you're arguing a biological claim (which is odd - the heart may beat at six weeks, but that brain is nothing yet. Also, if that's your line, what about the five weeks before?) which lacks the necessary legal and ethical arguments - because there's a person on the outside too, and they have rights too. We don't grant citizenship until live birth - and we legally argue all the time that non-citizens don't have standing. So how can a fetus make a claim to constitutional protections when it isn't a citizen? Why would we argue the constitutional protections of a non-citizen over those of a citizen? As for ethics, you are forcing somebody not to have an elective medical procedure they wish to have, to carry a child to term, and raise the child based on your personal (or religious ethics), and your personal definition of when something is alive, your personal definitions of when and where somebody has or doesn't have rights, none of which are based in law, and are at best contestable within the realm of science. This is the epitome of authoritarian behavior. You are enforcing your definitions, beliefs, morals, and choices onto another, with no regard for their choices, and when confronted, you circle the argument, by asking us to respect the desires of the fetus, which we don't know, or it's rights, which is again based on your definition of when a fetus gets rights, which is of course, when it's most convenient for your argument.

Usually states will allow district party chairs to choose electors. And since the results are public, the party can punish the local district office for defection. So you have electors that were already chosen for party fervor and loyalty, and who are given a significant penalty if they defect.

There is a huge problem with our education system I don't think we're even in the top 20 in education for christ sake there needs to be a government class in school teaching rights, policies, and cause and effect as early as middle school so we don't repeat the same problem.

I'd rather go out with someone who is as imperfect as myself than to go out with someone who is part of the same system that gave me such poor choices..hilary can deny it all she wants, her supporters can as well...she is a professional corrupt politician who knows all the loopholes, who knows how to keep the system blind, even if she sucks at hiding the evidence...so far...her connections in government are just as corrupt, she as trump has her own agenda, i'd argue that it's not her own and that she is controlled just like trump...by the parties and corporations that influenced their nominations .....so hate all you want, in the end what will hate accomplish but to give you an avenue to vent your own dissatisfaction in how the system is run, and give you a scapegoat to focus on? those in power wont give up the power, so corruption will continue to go unchecked...what is the fbi doing but sitting on its ass and watching the show...why? because my dear, the problem is out of hand and free choice is a lie.

Poor education has left the population weak in information and skill which leaves us susceptible to sham and duplicity. A used car salesman can sell more junkers more easily to someone who only has a drivers license but knows nothing about cars and machinery. That same salesman, however, will find it very difficult to sell a single one of those junkers to a trained and experienced auto mechanic. What we don't know can herd us.

They would rather be told how to live their life and how to vote by people who know less than they do? That is not poor education, that is plain foolishness or outright stupidity. Poor education of intelligent and rational people is a problem surmountable with education. Education is useless to fools who have no interest in learning anything they don't already know.

Ugj1esd0s_zyMHgCoAEC	0	0	2017-04-24 07:18:56	C. Roman	Donald Trump is a painful chapter in USA history we just need to get through, but he couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time. Russia stealing land from other countries, supporting a genocidal dictator, building a high-speed multi-warhead nuclear missile that cannot be intercepted and can hit the USA in minutes, China making moves to gain control of the South China Sea and all shipping, air travel, and commerce in that area, stomping out all opposition to its government, suppressing and controlling other countries through threat of overwhelming force, the utter collapse and failure of the Middle East, the collapse and failure of nations across the globe, the failure of democracy and western principles across the entire globe, global terrorism, climate change and being in the middle of a man-made mass extinction event, and so much more, and this is all before going into the hundreds of individual problems within our own nation, including a broken federal/state government, our freedoms being perverted to support activity that is conflict with everything our country stands for, a drug epidemic,, gross inequality, a broken medical system, and so much more. The world is so backlogged on generations upon centuries of unaddressed problems and new problems, the world needs stability and leaders who can work together to get everyone else to work together, to get things done. Donald Trump is not only incapable of this, he is hellbent on multiplying the numbers of problems, which is far worse than doing nothing. The question is, will anyone who comes in after him be able to handle 4 years of his mess and the messes that built up while he made his messes, not to mention all of the other problems that already existed and will crop up?

I&#39;m actually surprised that John Oliver didn&#39;t make the point that not only do we not know what Ivanka and Jared&#39;s qualifications are but that Trump has strategically positioned two people in his inner circle who won&#39;t question a thing Trump says. So now that he has replaced Bannon with Jared more or less... almost everything that comes from the president&#39;s office is Trump&#39;s idea. Trump just wants the appearance that people are advising him but when in actuality nobody is. This is pretty fucking scary tbh.

Once all the grandparents who lived through hell end up in convalescence homes or dead. At least it's 70 for the lifespans we're accustomed to. They live about 10 year shorter lives in Russia, so how coincidental that their flirtations with fascism kicked off a decade ago. The amount of Red Army soldiers rolling in their graves right now is legendary.	UCRqBygqFoeG7DTY8N1oSKQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRqBygqFoeG7DTY8N1oSKQg	1	UghYxgTtrswe6XgCoAEC	Lucas Balaminut

The person I was replying to called for the imprisonment of Trump, Pence, Ryan, McConnell, Ivanka, and Jared. You aren't simply protesting an incompetent POTUS if you're demanding his daughter be jailed against her civil rights because they share a last name! DUH! This person wants every prominent person in the Republican party that he could list jailed (and judging by their tone, likely supported the assassination attempt on the House majority whip). These blowhards don't care about the United States being a democratic government anymore; it's "represent my personal political ideals or lose your freedom / die". The militant left. Idiotic and disgusting.	UCoQIIOeizuuV3_zZmLo8OkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoQIIOeizuuV3_zZmLo8OkA	1	Ugj0kP1dhsy-q3gCoAEC	Krombopulos Michael

It's about having a bumbling, incompetent, incoherent fucktard as president who favors nepotism and favors-for-favors over putting actual competent people in charge of enormously demanding posts and tasks. Many of his opponents would be perfectly fine with a sane, competent Republican in the White House. And Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Kim Jong-un, North Korea should be way more up the alley of Trump supporters.

And please elaborate on how trusting the positive perception of the people who actually work and know Ivanka/Jared hundreds of times better than Oliver or anyone in this comment section (on BOTH sides of the political aisle) is "my funeral". Am I going to lose my job as a LT in the USN? My house? What am I saving if I suddenly decide to dislike them in order to placate your echo chamber ideals?

Everyone's first reaction would be to compare them to Bannon or Trump or Pence and come to the conclusion that since Ivanka and Jared haven't done anything ridiculously stupid yet they must be the "good guys". Being pleasing to the eye when compared to everyone else in the white house also helps quite a bit with how others perceive them. Basically it's a matter of relativity. Since everyone else is absolutely terrible, the least bad look good even though they aren't actually good. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if this was all Trump's master plan of getting his offspring into the white house later or something. Fill the white house with terrible people and have Jared and Ivanka look good among them so people have a good perception of them and then have them run for office some day. Meh, that being said, I doubt Trump has enough brain cells to actually think of a plan like that anyways.

The administration has made some spurious argument about the White house not being a federal agency, but Kushner's position makes him part of the Executive Office of the President, which is very much a federal agency. What it is, and what we're learning time and again with this administration, is that far too many of these rules were put in place with absolutely no power to enforce them.

To me, experience means FUCK ALL, if you want to govern good and govern well and as long as you maintain that. Hell, Obama was a senator - he is one of the worst presidents in my opinion AND he is a mass murderer. Hillary is also experienced, you say, huh? She is also one of the worst human beings ever to run for president, even considering Trump, but hey, she has experience. Face it America, you didn't have a good president in the last 50 years expect Jimmy Carter, and pretty much 3/4 of them had some experience with politics or managment, and they did fuck all. So why not give a chance to someone new, someone young, huh? All I see is old farts shaping the world for the next 50 years, when they are not going to be there to see it!

If I recall correctly, didn't one of Trump's offspring say something along the lines of "nepotism is a fact of life" or something? I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Trump just decided one day to say "fuck democracy, we're going to be a monarchy now" and name Jared as the next in line for the president of the United States.

This was a very ubcobtroversial piece if you watched it and addresses something that media on both sides and both parties are doing. He was hitting politics and both establishments with this piece as Dems want to feel safer that a group of middle of the road "Dems" as is being reporter over and over with ivanka and kush are taking over so everything is ok. On the other side how amazing these two are and this family is goes into the greatness of the president and his choices. But reality is no staffer gets that many responsibilities esp that many that big. And never with his non experience while cutting out the secretaries and heads of agencies. And Ivanka supports her father and their businesses that's how their professional relationship has always worked. Not off ideology but off of the practicality of what works best. And the pushing by the admin for these two to be calming voices has set it as a big game of good cop(s) bad cops. I think he pointed to an issue that hasn't been addressed well at all and was more a stab at MSM handling of this. The biggest part is he didn't even go into data on this one as much because that's the point, there is literally no data there as he said we know nothing about them of their true parts and such. Not even mentioning all the conflicts of interest. I'm independent so I like that he did this showing both sides doing odd things here.

If you look at Stephen Colbert, he bashes on Trump so much, yet he himself had a huge party when the Republicans gaind the majority in Congress. I never really watched John Stewart because he never really got me to laugh. He's not pretending to be a news anchor he is just bringing you information that the news and other media would otherwise cloud to improve their standing. I see no bias in this at all other than his political stance.

It might help some people sleep at night, but well, that might happen if you tend to label different opinions as propaganda and just move on. So, as a "not-a-sheep" affected by this "propaganda", please tell me why do you think Oliver is wrong and Ivanka is not a con women and can be trusted, and what exactly makes Jared a good choice for the positions he has been given.

When someone tells you the bus stops are shit, it doesn't really matter if it comes from the homeless guy who sleeps on them at night or the people in charge of their maintenence/building, or even the people who just use them daily. All you need to be able to do is like what he talked about with Ivanka and her stances, separate what actual facts are given from the comedy or the spin. For example, Oliver was right in that I truly don't know what Kushner sounds like, it may be because I'm not American but still, its a fact he opened my eyes to.
