It&#39;s like the whole Oval Office was suspended in amber.<br />Listening to how Giuliani outed Trump as being aware of the payments to Stormy Daniels shines a bright white light on how insane this entire process has been.<br />The story used to be, &quot;There was no affair with Stormy Daniels.&quot; <br />then it went to, &quot;There was an affair with Stormy Daniels, but there were no payments.&quot; <br />then it went to, &quot;There were payments to Stormy Daniels, but Trump knew nothing of it.&quot; <br />then to, &quot;Trump knowingly made the payments, but there was no Campaign Finance Violation.&quot; <br />then to, &quot;Trump directed Michael Cohen to commit a violation, but Trump didn&#39;t know that was illegal, and due to the wording of Campaign Finance Law, that means Trump did nothing illegal.&quot;<br />Then a video came out with Trump bragging about how nobody knew Campaign Finance Law as well as he.

They need battle definitions and Greek maths and philosophies and to stop chasing Captain Hook. &quot;It&#39;s not easy being cheezy, or something.&quot; Fear is contagious. Peace-mongering is a concealed weapon Class A. It&#39;s a fear of &quot;gooks&quot; and &quot;fine minds&quot; taking over. They confuse pain with peace. They&#39;re addicted to soda understandings. They confuse battle tactics with the domination of a man. They&#39;re egocentric users outcast from society clinging to Orwellian classics. If they don&#39;t know it, then it&#39;s not available. They&#39;re perverts off of ecstasy in need of sexual balance. People who look good must be on drugs. They&#39;re pop-psychology experts. The system doesn&#39;t make sense. Oh, they just lift a car regularly. You thought drugs would get you a mental illness ticket. You thought counterattacks were bogus and deception was illegal in battle. You thought Hollywood wasn&#39;t into botox agents and platform shoes and they were opposed to computers. You thought Manhattan Project meant Manhattan. You thought the X-Files meant the stars. Yeah, I&#39;ve heard of these. C&#39;mon, WALT and meet your DuPont.

It doesn&#39;t justify the loss of civil liberties, but it&#39;s an important part of Giuliani&#39;s legacy as mayor and the fact that he didn&#39;t address that is a major flaw.

He was probably on his way out and only was reelected because of the positive publicity he got for being the mayor during 9/11. He milked it for every bit of publicity he could get too. Football games, baseball games, he basically showed up anywhere he could to get shown on TV. America saw thru his charade a long time ago, that&#39;s why he never had a successful presidential campaign. He&#39;s a total fake, a farce. He&#39;ll shill for anyone who pays him enough, especially if the word republican is after their names.	UC8zbhsdYtyxGtaWcm2einsA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8zbhsdYtyxGtaWcm2einsA	0

How many of those feminists hold positions of power, for example political? Yes, feminism suffers from the "anyone that claims to be a feminist is a feminist" problem, or as i like to call it "lack of gatekeeping". However surveys show that most people, including most women, do not identify themselves as feminists, because feminism label has been made toxic by the fewer, but far worse, people that wave it around. Its not that all feminists are bad, its that the public ones have destroyed the image of feminism. Im willing to believe that the "silent majority" are good people, but the "woke" ones certainly are not.

Feminism is an ideology with a lot of variety, not a group with leadership which could exclude misandrists or TERFs. Pretty much everyone can identify as one (even popular author George R. R. Martin does), which makes it pretty inevitable that there are going to be some jerks. If you want to look at an ACTUALLY popular person with feminist (and generally left-wing) views here on YouTube, you might want to look at Natalie Wynn (aka ContraPoints). Or, you know, just read up on Feminist Theory. I'm not claiming that absolutely every feminist is a good person. But saying that they're all bad is just as ridiculous.

He declared the site safe for responders long way too early and as a result many of the real, unnamed heroes were left with debilitating and in some cases lethal diseases as a consequence. While he was posing on the cover of time magazine and soaking up the &quot;good will&quot;, there are plenty of stories that went unheard about people paying a horrific, terrible price, likely further compounded through our ridiculous healthcare system. A real leader understands that he or she is responsible for the people under their command, and somehow this atrocious disregard for safety went for the most part unmentioned while he was being paraded as a hero. I get that leaders must make difficult decisions and that error is part of being human, but I am sickened by how easily the post 9/11 victims were forgotten by that &quot;hero&quot; the moment he saw opportunity to capitalize. The cost of his accrued good will he over paraded was concealed so callously. Mr Guilanni have you no shame? No decency sir? <br /><br />This is a man who should be behind bars, not behind the camera. Politics aside, people matter, and they are worth more than the role of your campaign podium. Period.

At first I was impressed with him, but quickly it began to look like, he was using it to promote himself. And, when in the years after 9/11 he milked it for every bit of personal gain, he could grab, I lost the last tiny bit of respect, I had for him. Again not being an American, I had assumed, that he had gone on to welldeserved oblivion. But no. He is now back in what seems to be his true self: A demented attention seeking gargoyle, who really needs to go back to sitting on buildings in stoneform.

He&#39;d lost a part of his brain in a construction accident and didn&#39;t have a skull plate. He never seemed to be functionally impaired to me in any way but he had a big dent in his head. He also liked to wear a bright red beret. I swear this is true, he would let his ferret sleep on the beret nestled in the dent. He would walk around with a sleeping ferret curled comfortably in the spot where a piece of his head used to be. Really nice guy, but kinda memorable.

This is the guy who 1) Located the disaster command center in the same building that the terrorists had alraedy attacked, against the pleas of the emergency professionals, because, as he said, he wanted to be able to walk there from City Hall; and 2) Couldn&#39;t be bothered to arrange for the police radio communication to be compatible with the fire department communication. Which made the 9-11 death toll greater than it would have been under a competent mayor.	UCLMvX9pPjJHOtum56JYbOUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMvX9pPjJHOtum56JYbOUg	0

And after leaving office I don’t know if it counts but he had a cameo in Adam Sandler’s Anger Management too. I don’t like Rudy I’m just interested in trivia.

UgxPP7ylK-CUokCy0yN4AaABAg	0	0	2018-05-22 02:56:45	Cal Tocan	John Oliver has done a magnificent job in content and in his devotion to his show. The ferret but was truly iconic. What he missed here was that Giuliani really did clean up New York prior to 9/11. It used to be eerily similar to the likes of Detroit and Chicago with the gangs and government corruption of which he cleaned up. The problem was that the Ndw York Times despised this Republican leadership and only jumped aboard Giuliani&#39;s side when they absolutely couldn&#39;t attack him credibly anymore. However they still got their last licks by disingenuously saying &quot;he has redeemed himself.&quot; John needs to focus on the substantial accomplishments too if he wants to be taken seriously, and I know he claims he doesn&#39;t, but he&#39;s been throwing around the term &quot;obviously&quot; in support of subjective arguments lately; a sign of virtue signaling.

I don&#39;t like Hillary- I think she was careless in violating American national security, and needs a strong punishment. However, she stated she won&#39;t be running again, and people need to realize that Hillary is not a policy maker anymore. They should be focused on Donald Trump, specifically, getting him to stop with his myriad of scandals and start making policies. Besides his tax bill and bombing Syria twice, he hasn&#39;t been doing anything good.	UC2AWWzSGaKJDrsdW2v7r-Ow	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2AWWzSGaKJDrsdW2v7r-Ow	0

I didnt find any other way to contact you, so i’m doing this Tweet trump-style. I’m sorry. The gist of it is: BRAZIL.<br />Dear j. Oliver and writers, i wish you did an episode on Brazil. I think we have a political situation with some similarities to your own, and, if nothing else, we are a good cautionary tale. We made fun of our populist president for the crazy/objectively funny way she talked, but still, we reelected her. She then left the job, only to be replaced by her far worse vice, our current demon-president, Temer. Not to mention all the crazy corruption scandals we are going through - i think it might be worth your atention. I hope i made my point, this is not my native language, so im sorry if i seemed unpolite. Thank you and good bye.	UCFADdlj-QHAqTeqZQtWx9LA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFADdlj-QHAqTeqZQtWx9LA	0

He was investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader Michael Milken. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a ​3 1⁄2-year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine.[50] In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.[51]	UCQVN8RPxt2j-D80-NFNJBMg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQVN8RPxt2j-D80-NFNJBMg	0

And those people filled with shit and who produce shit from their hearts anyway like him because he makes their shit-producing hearts feel good about themselves. Narcissists!

So our beloved president reimbursed Cohen for the hush money he didn&#39;t know about paid to an adult actress he never saw and he never knew. All of this looks like some kind of a joke that&#39;s not funny anymore. So, what all of this BS spilling all over the world means for the average American people? The President thinks that all Americans are stupid and he&#39;s going to prove it all over again to the end of his mandate. Happy Great America people, enjoy!

UgzT4xqc62KwG86eGVJ4AaABAg	0	1	2018-05-11 19:25:11	Jamie Padfoot	John, please cover a little about what happened in Malaysia this week. It would be amazing. To summarise:<br /><br />We kicked out a 61 year old regime, which was headed by kleptocratic Najib Razak (who siphoned off about 2.67 billion Ringgit (or USD 700 million), and added 42 billing Ringgit (USD 11.73 billion) to the country&#39;s debt. To help pay some of this, he levied a Good &amp; Sales Tax of 6% on all layers of service. Means, raw material (6%) to processing (6%) to sale (6%), you&#39;d pay in effect, a total of 18%. <br /><br />What makes this story so whack is basically...<br /><br />Imagine the Republicans have been ruling since independence, with democrats being a small group of underfunded reps. Obama, previously on the Republican administration, till he started asking questions, got locked up by George Bush on bogus sodomy charges. <br /><br />Michelle Obama then enters politics to demand justice. Bush retires, and Trump takes over. Trump starts blatantly abusing the country&#39;s finances and systems, buying rich shit for Melania, getting more arrogant by the day. <br /><br />Just before elections, Bush comes out of retirement, asks Obama for forgiveness and promises to free him if they win. Bush turns Democrat by joining Michelle&#39;s party, and with some allies, they start campaigning. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Trump is pulling out all the stops to discredit and make it hard for them to secure any ground. He bans Bush&#39;s face on posters, phantom voters start popping up, postal ballots aren&#39;t delivered to overseas voters, etc. Even on election day, they cut electricity in some parts, attempt to sneak in doctored votes, etc. <br /><br />And still, the people prevail. After much delay, Trump concedes defeat. His republican party calls for his resignation. <br /><br />.... and that&#39;s how, Malaysia elected it&#39;s 7th Prime Minister, a 92 year old man who was previously it&#39;s 4th Prime Minister, and ex-mentor to the 6th Prime Minister whom he worked hard to defeat.

Clearly, he&#39;s decided misappropriating campaign funds is way more serious than paying off pornstars and lying to the media. He has the misfortunune of having an absolute shitshow for a client.

He was probably the most successful ever at taking down the Italian mafia. Look up his history as a US attorney, it’s wild. Also, as shitty as stop-and-frisk was... he completely transformed New York. Reduced murder by something like 70%. I feel like he’s the real life Harvey Dent; hero prosecutor who went batshit crazy.

And yes, I think Giuliani has lost his credentials with a lot of the comments, of which do support you. But let me tell you, people were not complaining for the most part with the drop in crime, which absolutely had to do with picking off the petty crime rather than going for criminal leaders, which hadn&#39;t worked in years! You were in the UK at the time, let&#39;s remember, and are likely surrounded by a lot of yes men. I do get it, that not everyone did well and I&#39;m not going to be a denier or racism. But PLEASE, New York was a disaster area for decades, 42nd street was a pile of garbage, and mayors prior to him massively failed at keeping New York safe.<br />So tell the whole story, please, not just the parts that support you, or conveniently spin your stories which is pretty low if you&#39;re going to pound your fist on the table. You do a lot of great, John Oliver. This clip not so much, not that close, even.	UCde7rxWTYtJIZM49VF5o8mg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCde7rxWTYtJIZM49VF5o8mg	0

Guess what, that D.A. is hooking up with the sex trade. <br /><br />Just remember, “Why doth thee protest so loudly?” Answer that and your good to go. <br /><br />Carry on.

Is there any better revenge, andaccess to commit such, than as a man&#39;s legal representation? And does the Donald even feel the stiletto [pardon, &quot;shiv&quot; since they are mafia mavens] getting stuck between his ribs, or smell the garlic it is coated in to keep the wound open and bleeding out?

I would strongly recommend that you see the three videos links below and just please do remember that Donald Trump artistically is playing the media purposefully to smooth the path to his deleterious goals.<br />I, personally, have no clue of what his detrimental decisions are for and what he has in mind for your nation, he might be even dearly in love with your country and he might have good intentions of the nature of which I have no idea, but I have always believed that his decisions are causing collateral damage to the whole humanity, the best example of which is to the people in my country.<br />As you might notice according to the following videos, he is no fool at all, or at least he is not all alone in this and he is implementing all the help that he can in what he is doing. Moreover, I feel that you mean no harm either to your nation or others, I might be wrong and even think to innocently and naively about you or your intentions, no offense, but at least I have seen that you have always intended to give awareness to people and invited them to think critically, so I just wanted to ask you to point out to his politically smart, yet ethically reprehensible standpoints and raise the public understaning of his real intentions, means and duplicity.<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/_aFo_BV-UzI">https://youtu.be/_aFo_BV-UzI</a><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/hBweUnkfQ2E">https://youtu.be/hBweUnkfQ2E</a><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/wkvvAQxxo_0">https://youtu.be/wkvvAQxxo_0</a><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/geEVwslL-YY">https://youtu.be/geEVwslL-YY</a><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/1LGsCnyEp8c">https://youtu.be/1LGsCnyEp8c</a><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/Tva0xq-eDvI">https://youtu.be/Tva0xq-eDvI</a><br /><br />Please do watch them since they wouldn&#39;t take much of your time and two thumbs up to only some of the jokes and interpretations.

These were in his intelligence briefings as imminent threats, so when he&#39;s at a kid&#39;s school when shit is going down, having not chosen to read intelligence briefings, we realize it did not matter much to him if at all. I&#39;m guessing the real reasons are classified. And Colin Powell was sent under the bus. He was expendable, but it was known and furthermore, he being Colin knew about it. If not there would be a greater backlash. Rudy, he&#39;s the fall guy now, and should be considering his claim to fame is a fake disaster created just to go to war and support the war complex to create money to create power. That all said own it. That also said he is looking for the end of the world still, and still trying to cash in before he dies.

(Austin was anti-Dutch and anti-Belgian, plus Dr.Evil was raised by a Belgian couple).

I don&#39;t know if the Trauma of loosing a few of his good friends in 2001 did it, or something else happened between 2001 -2007. But he has definitely declined in either will or intellect in some way. By 2008, when I listened to him, he was a completely different person, much less focused than he used to be in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s. In 2018, he makes no sense at all.

We created the Islamist extremism threat, we literally put the craziest people we could find into power hoping they would fight the Russians. I feel that my point was more of an oversimplification of the differences between modern theologies. There exist Muslims in America who follow the american dream and western ideals despite what the Quran says in much the same way Christians do. The thing is that Christians seem to delude themselves into thinking their religious book is more peaceful than others. I'm pointing out that there is all of the same barbarism in both books. It is all interpretation and application that is what is important. I understand that the situation that we see in the middle east is much more complicated than that though	UCDmWXY9o4Zq4j-E1mgGY83g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmWXY9o4Zq4j-E1mgGY83g	1	UgxdsnoFNtqtq3WT05J4AaABAg	Vincent Cuti

I can't believe this callousness. It had to be a joke, right? Other than that, I'm glad you acknowledge Muslims as human beings. Again, this should go without saying. But we live in interesting times... I have a opposite opinion on one thing tho: I think Muslims are devout to their religion exactly because we're living in this world, and it's not always been the case. For example Afghanistan first had women suffrage in 1965. Iran in 1963. By comparison, one small canton in Switzerland didn't have it until 1990... This is a video of an old Egyptian president (women in Egypt got the right to vote the same year he was elected, 1956), mocking the idea of making the veil mandatory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4RK8bj2W0 and you can hear the public laughing and cheering and taking for granted that the veil was something belonging to the past–of the 50's! Another thing: in the beginning Arab terrorists weren't necessarily Muslim terrorists. Back when you still didn't have to pass a metal detector to board a plane, some groups of Palestinians thought it would be a great idea to resort to hijacking. These early groups were almost exclusively leftist and secular. Terrorism quickly became a very ugly business, but it wasn't until 1982 in Lebanon that suicide bombings by religious groups appeared. Thing is, from WWII to 1979 you basically had two choices on the market of ideas: Western democracy or socialism. Iran briefly went for socialism before the CIA stepped in deciding democracy was better. Palestinians and a lot of other Arabs chose some shade of socialism, either because they already had a taste of Western democracy under the British or French Colonial Empires and didn't like it, or because they noticed how democratic the USA-backed Absolute Ruler known as the Shah of Iran was. Plus other special cases, more on this later. But being socialist meant being friends with the USSR, which was a rather intrusive friend. And how intrusive the USSR could get became apparent in 1979 when they invaded Afghanistan. So Western democracy always had a so-so street cred, and socialism also proved to be less than ideal. Who's left, asks himself the Arab nationalist, orphan of ideologies, desperate for guidance, no matter how unlikely or ill-advised that could be. Enter Beardy McTheocracy... alias Ayatollah Khomeini, circa 1979 Iran. And from there it just went down the shithole. The USA chose the worst people to be friends with, and they showed how much of a real friend they are when they turned their backs to Saddam in 1991. Everybody who clinged to the USSR lost their daddy the same year. It was a huge ideological void, and militant Islamism was the only thing to fill it with. Remember those special cases? Like the house of Saud. Basically a bunch of aggrandized desert brigands. They helped the Brits in WWI and got a good deal out of it. But how can someone who was little more than a camel thief become all of a sudden king to the whole Arabian peninsula? Just the Brits being ok with it is not enough. You need a cleric for that divine right. So it happens you have to keep Western democracies as friends, because they're the ones who put you there, AND the very undemocratic clerics too, because they're the ones who keep you there. The clerics also happen to dislike Beardy, their successful Shia cousin, and they send one of the Saud to Afghanistan to show them Sunni too can have political influence, and the Americans very unwittingly help this guy because he dislikes the Soviets without understanding he dislikes the USA too. Like. A lot. And then Arab political leaders find out they now need religion like it was some sort of political science degree, people who never gave a shit about veils come to see them as what gives them an identity, Saddam who saw theocracy as his number one ideological foe (and kept hating it more than the Bushes who kicked his ass and officially stated so before being hanged) had to begrudgingly introduce religious reforms to appease his own brand of clerics, and yadda yadda. I'm sorry if you already knew that and I know it's an oversimplification that leaves out a lot of details. My point is that Arabs and other non-Arab Muslims have become more religious because of geopolitical reasons. I'm an atheist, and I can't believe a book can have such a hold over billions just because of what's written in it. Because it wasn't written by a god, it was written by humans, for human purposes. It has become more relevant because it's a tool and it was there and it now has very practical uses. If they didn't have this ideological tool they would have invented something else, or recycled the Jedi force from Star Wars, or some other stuff, but the Quran was there and it's been used in the past and they just had to put inside the meanings they need for their goals. I saw an interview with an old Egyptian lady telling how much she liked Western fashion when she was young, and how her granddaughter wears a veil. Because when she was young balancing between Western and Soviet influence made the country richer, and now that she's old the world is a complex place with a lot of new players and if you want to compete against the heavyweights like the USA or Russia or a unified Europe or China or India or Brazil you need an ideological glue to keep Arabs together, and that's religion with all of its anachronisms, like a granddaughter being more conservative than her grandmother. It's good to know about religion, but it's a mistake to think modern society's problems derive from religion, or worrying if religion is compatible or not. There's no gods fighting each other. Just shady humans with shady agendas who put words in gods' mouths. There have been real grievances, and that's why those words resonate so much. Let's concentrate on the grievances and the shady agendas. Remembering that it's always people we're talking about helps too. One last thing for people other than Vincent who inexplicably read all this stuff. In case you are a believer, I'm not interested in changing that belief. You can ignore the parts where I say who I think is the author of holy texts, and the rest still holds true, and that's what really matters.

Generally I don't like Islam either as its not compatible with our society but only in the same sense that Christianity isn't compatible with modern society. The bible has just as much gruesome evil bs as the qaran. The only difference is the Muslims typically follow their book more literally and don't do any cherry picking. For instance some christians have tattoos, some are obese, women wear pants, people mix clothing, all of those things are forbidden in the bible but they're ridiculous so they're ignored if christians were as devout to their own religion as Muslims then we would be living in an entirely different world. But that aside, they are people and are you really capable of viewing yourself as a good and decent person when your respect and value for human life is so disturbingly low.

For one, the amount who switched to voting for Clinton was pretty average compared to other candidates (when you take into account that many Republicans supported Sanders too). Secondly, college debt is the least of it: Clinton earned hundreds of thousands of dollars making speeches to the finance sector, which is well known as a loophole for bribes, and there was zero indication she cared about social or economic issues in general. These are perfectly legitimate reasons to not support a candidate. Sanders also released tax plans which detailed how rates would be adjusted to fit his welfare policies, and if anything he wouldn't *stop* talking about taxes. You must be a very dishonest person to make such claims, and overall your comments reek of a strawman argument. The actual reason Clinton won was overwhelming support from minority voters rather then fiscally responsible or libertarian ones, and of course because of the scheming of the party machine. This distracts from the wider point that Hillary Clinton was not *owed* votes by the people, who so callously betrayed her. What a pathetic argument.

Rudy went on air saying, "Maybe at some point trump used some campaign money by-monthly to pay back his lawyer for the Stormy hush money, and it doesn't matter." Doesn't matter?! WTF? Even if it was only a dollar of campaign money it matters because her statement WOULD have gotten more votes for Hilary...not that would have been the best alternative either, but that is another conversation all together. But the fact that their argument of misappropriating campaign funding to low ball a porn star isn't a crime worthy of investigation is in itself a crime. My head is spinning right now. I bet Hoffa's body will be found and connected to trump and that balding pinhead will get away with it.

Or are they mostly just attractive candidates? Honest question. Because I can see how the job might prepare you for certain aspects but not all. Thank you.

There&#39;s a lot of problems with mutations you would think but I dont seem to ever hear of any alarm being sounded for that cultural practice to be stopped.....

To claim Giuliani's comments about Hillary are "true" while John Oliver's entire show is "propaganda" shows some pretty heavy bias on your part. That does seem to point to you being either a paid Russian troll or a dupe of right wing propaganda. There is no objective truth on either side here, but deciding that the side that aligns with your views has the monopoly on truth is pretty moronic...

It is legal in every US state to marry your second cousin. and legal in 20 states to marry your FIRST cousin (with some excluding double cousins) +5 states that allow first cousin marriages that are without the chance of having children. there is virtually no increased genetical risk for a second cousin pregnancy (estimated: 2-3% genetical disability is the chance for unrelated couples ~3,5% for second cousins) and it was more common to happen than you think. Plus if genetics were the sole reason same-sex couples within a family should NOT be an issue to anyone (other than homophobics) but general reactions say otherwise. Some families dont even have a problem if the relationship goes awry. The actual reason it is frowned upon or regarded as creepy is "Well I wouldn't fuck MY sibling/cousin/parent eww". And thats it.

Although we were both in agreement regarding the general inanity of the HBO show, my friend was surprised when I explained that the real insidiousness of it is its unmistakably hypnotic structure and pacing. I ended up pulling up an episode or two off of YouTube to show her what I meant. Every episode of this show follows the same repetitive format: present some "argument" and "facts" for about 10 seconds, then quickly follow these up with a snarky quip (which overwhelmingly take the form of non-sequiturs or absurd metaphors) before any rational processing of the preceding argument can take place in the mind of the viewer. Further, the only 'beats' or mental pauses in the show's pacing exists solely to highlight the approving laughter or applause from the studio audience. Repeat this basic formula without variation about 20 to 40 times in a row and you have one of the 12-20 minute segments that form the backbone of the show. The end effect is (obviously) not to deliver information, but rather to literally teach the viewers on a subconscious level to mentally associate derisive laughter with any person or opinion that is at odds with the narrative's take on the chosen issue. And it accomplishes this by maintaining a strict adherence to a roughly 20-second cycle in which a stimulus is presented, and a response is cued. This is the sense in which the show is fundamentally hypnotic.	UCuTy5PPvzeP5bYWRkoWWGlg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuTy5PPvzeP5bYWRkoWWGlg	1	UgwPtwnCVBiML7tJDeB4AaABAg	ILoveKimPossibleAlot

But your political views seems to have made you shallow and biased yourself. Her content is completely unrelated, but you label anyone as liking John Oliver as having "trash" critical thinking abilities. This is a comedy show, not a news show. I would like you to tell me which news sources you trust and rely on. From your polarised views I bet they can be easily criticised, but that you will heavily defend them. But hey, prove me wrong, give me examples of trustworthy sources and content which you deem as not "propaganda".

Touche is a word one uses to acknowledging someone else making a good counter-argument or witty point in a discussion you're in (or scoring a point in a fencing match) I got no idea what a "double touche" would be, two successful counter-arguments made one after another? Since they are both of french origin/french(I think) I can see why you might mix them up. It's touche as in touch, you touched on a good argument or you touched a scoring hit in fencing. Maybe knowing that will help you remember.	UCLDMAgkKgRs893jq7nvkEJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLDMAgkKgRs893jq7nvkEJg	1	Ugzjez6dPwfC1qvtvOR4AaABAg	István Sipos

Both an accurate representation of the heat of that hellfire zing, and the combined satisfaction and disappointment of the fact that people in Europe are experiencing, semi-ironically, disappointment *and* a twisted satisfaction from our absurd state of affairs. Laugh, it's the best we can do. We got our own concern and laughs about some of the BS going down in some European countries, only to outdo them all with the Trump embarrassment. Good thing is the world seems to be getting smaller. Bad thing is we have incompetent idiots as the main reason why lately. We just feel similar pain.

Specifically about the 9/11 badgering and especially when Ron Paul maturely brought up that blow-back is the primary reason that we got attacked on 9/11 and then Giuliani interrupts him immediately yelling at him and saying a couple &#39;Merica&#39;s and 9/11&#39;s, like the idiot he is, and then the crowd erupted...... that&#39;s so damn toxic. Especially when Dr. Paul was saying (yet another) thing people really needed to listen to.<br /><br />He&#39;s an idiot, he only cares about himself, he uses 9/11 constantly for his own gain (which is like swearing on your deceased mother&#39;s grave as collateral for trust), and he knowingly lies and manipulates people.

She&#39;s not a humanitarian, she&#39;s not a politician, she&#39;s not an educator, or a philanthropist. At best, she&#39;s intelligent and pretty. There are a freakishly high number of powerful, old white dudes fixating on her as some weird messiah figure in the Trump era, despite not being able to tell me or anybody else a single meaningful quality she has to be deserving of that fixation. <br /><br />I&#39;d stop thinking it was weird if somebody could tell me a single objectively beneficial quality she has in respect to the American people that makes her such a popular talking point for newscasters and politicians.

Which is worse no evidence of collusion costing the American taxpayer millions of dollars or Selling Uranium (Nuclear material) to the Russians? Which party uses the one thing every time to speak which is illegal BTW. Only proving the fact they are not the champion of the Act nor have a clue what it means. They owned humans, voted against all human rights, sold American values to foreign enemies, and have been butt hurt since the Civil War. Sorry that the hijacked education system left most of you unable to read, but crimes are occurring daily and you jump right in bed with the oppressor. They line their bank accounts of your suffering never fixing anything since its how they make money. The new plantation or inner city. And the newest baby the illegal alien as the newest slave. They were a role model to the Nazi&#39;s who by the way only pushed their hate for 12 years The Democratic Party has been doing their Hate for 190 years and counting. The fucking turds pat themselves on the back for the 1965 Civil Rights Act. But if they would have been obeying the LAW from 1865, 1868, and 1870 there wouldn&#39;t have been a need for the 1965 Act. They have always made money off the poor, and have twisted truth and logic to maintain that money. Obama entered office under a million. Left office over 50 million. You and I were saddled with 20 Trillion in Debt. All those foreign pussy wanna be males telling us how to manage our nation can juggle my nuts in their mouth. Fuck off faggots told you 242 years ago, nothing has changed. Democrats killed Lincoln, Kennedy, King, and now watch Trump&#39;s life is not safe. But if they do harm or try this country will see blood in the streets again. It&#39;s been too long coming and personally as a native American i&#39;m thirsty for some blood.

The typical terrible Republican stuff and enabling police brutality and racial profiling are his worst crimes, but it&#39;s always bothered me how anti-porn stores he was. Me, I&#39;m too embarrassed to walk into some place and buy overpriced DVDs with naked ladies on them, but they&#39;re a legitimate business, damn it, and they are entitled to their existence as much as McDonald&#39;s or Starbucks.

Adoptions and multiple marriages can result in you being &quot;related&quot; to people you don&#39;t even share any genetics with. For example, if your dad&#39;s adopted sister has a child, that child is technically your first cousin, but they aren&#39;t biologically related to you. Or, if your biological uncle marries someone with a child from a previous marriage, that child (step-cousin?) would also be your first cousin, but not biologically.<br />Either way, from a genetic standpoint, second cousins are (usually) fine; it&#39;s a societal taboo more than anything else. (I say &quot;usually&quot; because small DNA pools over multiple generations can be problematic.)	UCEa7RvOGAG7SRwTlD6idevw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEa7RvOGAG7SRwTlD6idevw	0

The police and firefighters favored one radio with the ability to talk to each other when the need arose. Giuliani favored one sold buy A company that a friend had a financial interest in, which the police and firefighters deemed too weak with a limited number of channels. The dispute was still ongoing when 9/11 occurred, the police tried to call the firefighters back but they just kept going up, blocking the stairwells and causing hundreds of needless deaths. Much of the confusion following the attacks was caused by the lack of communication between the different first responders! BTW-The attacks occurred while Bush was president.

Technically it is not legal to knowingly pay someone "hush money" during a negotiated settlement. But just the payment to Stormy Daniels should be sufficient to make (a weak) case of illegal political influence, (because it could be seen as suppression of information in the "public interest").

Alternative fact. That word is the scary reality that politics has become. They can&#39;t simply lie to your face, but they can&#39;t tell you the truth. So, make it sound less evil.

In terms of weirdness factor, I expected that he&#39;d touch upon Giuliani&#39;s drag queen appearances, one of many parallels that makes him a contemporary J. Edgar Hoover. Perhaps John excluded that fact because there&#39;s no harm in wearing drag, yet I always found it pretty strange considering Giuliani&#39;s constituency. A more salient point against Giuliani which I wish Oliver had included was Rudy&#39;s ill-fated decision to put the terrorist response center in the World Trade Center despite it having already been bombed before 9/11. The image of him walking through the debris and dust deserves re-examination once you learn that he hamstrung the city&#39;s response because of this poor judgment. Had the terrorist response center been placed in a location that wasn&#39;t a likely target for attack, New York could have improved its handling of the crisis on 9/11. Also, I&#39;ve heard many describe his treatment of the homeless problem as less a solution, a fix to the problem, than a crackdown that wiped it away, which escalated the human cost.

Prime example, I live in Hell&#39;s Kitchen(midtown west) a neighborhood that Pre-Giuliani was full of street walkers, open air drug market, and unregulated homeless people. Now you&#39;re not getting a one bed room apartment for under 3 grand a month. <br /> If he never stepped up and made it his goal to eliminate as much of that element as possible regardless of Pr, who would of? Bloomberg would of folded to people like the woman in the video. He was able to succeed because that was taken care of. <br /> So without the guy John Olivers portraying as a borderline racist and habitual line stepper; You could say good bye to the unprecedented development we&#39;ve seen over the last 20 years	UC_RnyY-B5bwr_8wNXIY08aA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_RnyY-B5bwr_8wNXIY08aA	0

I couldn't ask for a better example of a Jon Oliver viewer in my comments. Lol. Seriously, thank you. Here. I'll make it clearer for you since you're having some trouble. I have already stated the premise of the conversation, and you didn't respond. So... "actually having a conversation" apparantly starts with me agreeing that Guiliani is bad for Trump... which I obviously don't. He was great on tbe campaign trail. He has been Trump's lawyer for two seconds and the left puts out smear campaigns like this already. Why would Trump, a billionaire, use campaign funds to pay off a whore? The left uses the dumbest argument possible because they have already convinced you Guiliani is bad without explaining why with a weird documentary of his life. He had some rough patches. What does this have to do with him being bad for Trump again? Nothing. So, they make him look bad to make it appear as though the easiest exaplanation of all time looks dumb coming from his mouth. They do this because they know he is right and hate Trump. Got it? I thought all of this was summarized nicely by the post you were responding to. Since it went right over your head, here is an explanation of my position. You obviously don't consume right wing media. I guess I expected too much of you. So, there's my argument, explained in excruciating detail for you. I insult the opposition because they can't form an argument. You insult the opposition because you don't have an argument.

It was horrible seeing him being romanticized as &quot;America&#39;s Mayor&quot; after 9/11. During his mayorship, he did clean up Times Square but we are still reeling from broken windows policing that lets cops kill people for doing things like selling cigarettes on the street. RIP Eric Garner. When 9/11 did happen though, he did basically the bare minimum and let hatemongers go after brown people because they look like the enemy. And all that recovery and rebuilding efforts afterward, that was left to Bloomberg because his term was up anyways and back then, we had term limits so thank God for that. I&#39;m not gonna get into Bloomberg now but I will say that Giuliani milked the whole &quot;America&#39;s mayor&quot; Thing which is so fucked up. in , he even voiced his ire when there was a new Islamic community center being built just blocks from the World Trade Center site, something even citizen Trump did then too, like most of the GOP because of a crapton of xenophobic reasons. A little foreshadowing perhaps? <br /><br />I&#39;m glad everyone is seeing the real Rudy Giuliani for who he is, a narcissistic jerk who disrupts everything and peppers a little racism in everything. Just ask an old timer New Yorker and they can attest to that. Much like Trump, the media just eats him up, maybe now they&#39;ll learn their lesson? OF COURSE NOT! The media is still profiting off of these clowns.	UC9HIyweyKHwkF_oe1Du_sdA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HIyweyKHwkF_oe1Du_sdA	0

He got crime rates down and really cleaned the city up, he even prosecuted the mafia back when he was a federal attorney. That thing about the police being &quot;licensed to do w/e they want&quot; was more true under the Bloomberg administration than under Giuliani, and is still true even now. Police in this country are held to low standards and rarely held accountable for anything, NYC is sadly not an exception (despite some efforts from our current mayor).

I&#39;m surprised Last Week Tonight keeps getting simple fact checking wrong. Clinton signed off on the Uranium One deal while Russia funneled money to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton was receiving speaking fees from Russian banks. Establishment sycophants make excuses for Clinton but those events did take place. Trump is the wrong person to point fingers since he appears to have committed financial crimes, but that doesn&#39;t make Clinton a perfect angel.

It is at 2-4% while Donald Trump and Ivanka would have a 25% risk. So this comparison is both far fetched and unfair. Giuliani&#39;s life has enough weird stuff to offer so you don&#39;t have to overstress this fact.<br />Also, marriage between second cousins is very common in some cultures. As a liberal host, John Oliver should be careful here, he might offend a lot of people unwillingly. Remember that he once said that the rules of sex are the same as those for a fist fight - if not all participants are grown-ups able to make their own decisions and are taking part voluntarily, you are committing a crime. This applies here as well.	UC3RlIDcX85-_T8V9Z5oHE3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RlIDcX85-_T8V9Z5oHE3Q	0

In NY (city and state) Giuliani was universally hated, which is why he hasn't held public office since reaching his Mayoral term-limit in 2001, despite having run for Senate (he lost to Hillary Clinton, who had never held elected office and wasn't even from New York!) and having run for President in 2008. New Yorkers weren't fooled by his "America's Mayor" act; he took credit for the huge, well-funded police force established by the previous mayor... but Giuliani used those police to abuse power, encourage racial profiling, and harass black and Hispanic New Yorkers, while refusing to accept responsibility for the civil rights violations he personally demanded. Meanwhile, the city benefited from a great economy, as Bill Clinton's national policies turned the Reagan/Bush era national debt into a surplus. When Giuliani's term ended, Bloomberg systematically eliminated Giuliani's racist policies, including "stop & frisk." Once Giuliani and his disgusting ideas were gone - despite his loud claims/warnings that the systematic civil rights violations Giuliani enforced were the only thing preventing NYC from becoming America's murder capital - NYC's overall crime rate including its murder rate *dropped* far below where it had been while Rudy was in charge of the city.

Not 1 baby photo, no plants, no Hang in There kitten posters. The message: ONLY I MATTER. RG has always been a schmuck. And for someone of Irish &amp; Italian descent he has no right being racist.

Furthermore you are only allowed to have papers on your desk if you were working on them actively. If you were not actively working on them then you had to put them back in the appropriate drawer. Also forget about having lots of highlighters on your desk or the drawer open to have access to lots of pens and highlighters. By the time I left there I found that a lot of the habits grew on me and the only way I found happiness working was to be extremely neat in other offices. So basically in every other office I was driven mad bye the lack of cleanliness and the and the lack of type of working condition.

Even when he was running for an actual office, the entire Democratic party didn&#39;t even go like this. You called the comment about Ivanka as &quot;SLEAZY&quot; (emphasized because well he did), &quot;He said she was a fine woman&quot;, seems to me like your putting your feelings on his words. Then you called his comments so ill advised and chaotic, Then you show reporters telling me how they FEEL about his comments???? Actually what it sounded like is they were trying to discredit him (giving their personal feeling of how they see it) not an actual anything like news worthy. No news, Feelings. i thought CNN, MSNBC, blah blah blah was supposed to report the news, not how they felt. i could care less. they are reporters not feelers. i am smart enough to make up my own mind if they will give me the facts. see facts help you find the truth because one side can always rebut your facts with their facts. you have to be smart enough to take the facts and come to a truth. With this broadcast you kind of showed me yours. You know the whole picture. Sorry John, i am going to have leave you. i have watched for many years and loved many a program, but this nah.

Because every argument I've heard regarding ferrets is utterly flawed or complete BS. Most of those "exotic" pets would not be able to survive in the wild at all, and only a few would live long enough to affect the ecosystem. Ferrets in particular make no sense: they have a very restricted temperature range that they could survive in, so CA's weather would either boil or freeze them. They have escaped or been dumped in the past and not affected the chicken population as most farmers are "worried" about. And there are a few native varieties of Ferrets, and they have not worried the chicken ranchers.

Being on term while a terrorist attack happens is a reputation-saver. Almost like dying for an actor or singer, but without having to die, which is quite convenient. For them, I mean.

He was probably a very talented attorney, at least in the past. He was a U.S. Attorney. And he was apparently somewhat of a "Mob Buster" (though Oliver claims it's random that he hosted the AMC series). If you want to try to discredit or demonize someone, as so many seem so willing to do, you might want to research the person in depth. If Oliver talked about stop and frisk, that's another thing... Stop and frisk seems a clear violation of freedom.	UC0UQ4K5gcvAtZOTILfOSoxg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0UQ4K5gcvAtZOTILfOSoxg	1	Ugz8WJI7bQuZbETJSQJ4AaABAg	Dreadnought O.o

I don't know about your claims about him denying healthcare, and that sounds terrible, but this was not discussed in the video. Further, I am not here to be a Giuliani apologist. I never argued that Giuliani was good or bad. I just stated that he has done some good. Giuliani could be the devil incarnate, but this video is not accurate and does not establish his supposed awfulness. I will not suppose that I can assess the value of an individual. And the point I made was not addressed by your tirade. You may revisit my very simple comments on John Oliver's inaccuracy and his fans willingness to jump on the bandwagon. Maybe you can agree, accuracy is important, especially when you're attempting to discredit someone. And finally, look up "ad hominem". It's not legitimate. "And nobody thinks John Oliver's a genius, unless we're using you as a baseline of intelligence, than John Oliver's God almighty in comparison." haha *Wouldn't God Almighty compared to me would still be God Almighty compared to you or anyone else; wouldn't God possess ultimate intelligence? The ultimate is ultimate whether compared to the least among us, like me, or someone like you. I guess you're saying John Oliver is God Almighty. Big mistake, Marcus!

World's greatest father? Passable husband? Maybe he REALLY did take efforts to fight corruption instead of just talking about it (which I doubt). None of these things are being talked about. You just saw a video that asserted that Guiliani used 9/11 as a scape for his political campaign and prospective million+ dollar book deal. Facts: This man became rich and attempted to become powerful by using America's most publicized terrorist attack of the last century as a talking point attesting to his greatness, all while systematically and repeatedly refusing to offer healthcare benefits for the estimated thousands of firefighters and police officers who ingested parts of the cloud and would develop a range of illnesses, including many cancers, after the fact. Nobody, (except you) cares if he has done ANY good in the face of that kind of willful disregard for his own people. This video is not an dissertation looking back on the long life of Guiliani, where we cover all the good he did as a child, like the time he fed a dog, once. His most recent exploits are using terrorism to rise above his station and joining Trump's legal team. So we're talking about it. Get fucking over it. And nobody thinks John Oliver's a genius, unless we're using you as a baseline of intelligence, than John Oliver's God almighty in comparison.

It is really not a big deal in most societies, the US being maybe the strongest exception (in some of it's states more than others). Children of unrelated couples have roughly a chance of 97.5% to not inherit a genetic disease. With first cousins this lies at about 95%. High age alone can result in a far higher risk than this 2.5% increase. I really love John Oliver's show, but these jokes are not helping those living in less fortunate environments, having to endure stigmatization. In the end though this was just a comedic insensitivity and I have no troubles looking past it.

I by contrast, draw the line at first cousins. Anyone more distantly related to you than first cousins is fair game. Even the first cousin incest taboo is heavily exaggerated, as you have the same risk of genetic problems with a genetic stranger when you both are in your 40's.

At some point, your nth degree cousins are as closely related to you as the average genetic stranger. Just because you have to go back to a generation who lived before humans had a written language, to find an ancestor in common, does not mean you are not blood relatives. Standard second cousins are so far apart that the concern of inbreeding is perceived problem that doesn't exist. Every degree of separation that cousins are, the shared DNA drops off exponentially. Standard siblings share half of their DNA that varies within the species, and standard first cousins, a sixteenth. Second cousins, a thirty-twoth. A fraction you think about so little, you didn't even realize that "thirty-twoth" is not the correct way to write it out, and that it is really "thirty-second".

Some are just more nuts than others. Just need to kind of pick your poison. Giuliani was a nut job, but he was better than Cuomo. Also, TRADITIONALLY, men are seen as disposable, so it&#39;s not that out of line for him to say that. We say there&#39;s &quot;equality&quot; and women are &quot;oppressed&quot;, but traditionally speaking all throughout history in all sorts of different cultures, the men go off to fight the war to protect their city, women, and children. So yes, throughout history men are seen as disposable, as they are generally seen as the strongest physically.	UC1x1pHjMciUAJmRklj_lDVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1x1pHjMciUAJmRklj_lDVQ	0		
UgzlwtpWmU7_BOvnyj14AaABAg.8fxbx9A4ax28fy21XT7C87		2	2018-05-07 22:18:38	DN FI	Men were not sent out to war because they were more disposable, they were sent out to war because they were the only ones deemed fit to fight. Cultures that considered women worthy of battle, sent them into battle just fine. Women, throughout history and across many cultures had very little in the way of rights (whether it was property, citizenship/vote, family law or access to education and participation in high-status professions), certainly they were valued less than men (you don't see a lot of stories about kings breaking their country away from the Catholic Church and forming a new religion in the quest for a female heir, do you now?), but their lives were safeguarded (for the most part) because someone had to make more humans. If all the men in a city die, the women and the children can rebuild it. If all the women and children die...the city will go on for a while, but who the hell will produce the next generation? It doesn't have anything to do with the values of the individuals, it has to do with value for the community and being smart about survival. That is why women and children are traditionally given priority in disaster situations. But if you want to believe water is dry, things fall up and women have never been oppressed, I suppose ignoring the fact that your great grand mother was not born at a time when women could vote is an option too.

I kept him fed and his litter clean and would let him roam the apartment after I &quot;ferret proofed&quot; almost everything. Almost because they can find holes you never thought existed. Otherwise there&#39;s nothing like seeing a blindish ferrert start chortling and hopping all around in excitement because you are home, then try running off for you to chase it only for it to run into a wall...

This is the worst pick trump could have made, Seems to me mr. giulani has some bones to pick with mr. trump. Because, he perhaps wanted some recognition after having showed his support for mr. trump, and he did not get it. Interesting. Thank you anyway for helping me to put things into perspective.

(It takes generations of breeding <i>first</i> cousins before it starts becoming a birth-defect problem). Granted, with America&#39;s current population, these days we have no excuse but to find someone who is entirely genetically divergent.<br /><br />Also Rudolph was a baby boomer. (Born in 1944) meaning most couples from his parents generation were in arranged marriages. If Guliani&#39;s family is aristocratic enough his might have been arranged as well.

Slightly weak bullying there Mr. Oliver. But overall, so glad you&#39;re around! Your SAVAGE sense of humor is much appreciated.)

Hillary ran as Obama 2.0 offering nothing but more of the same when Obama 1.0 was a massive failure leading the country into more death and war while addressing none of the root causes that lead to the economic collapse, rising costs of education and healthcare, erosion of privacy, rights and a widening gap of wealth distribution.

I get it, he&#39;s the president, and he does a lot of stupid things, but aren&#39;t you beating a dead horse at this point? Your show is much bigger than your main story, so can you talk about Trump before or after, and make the main story about literally anything else?

He did an entire piece on this man this week, which was alright, I guess, but what about the trial of Mark Zuckerberg? A piece on privacy and the commercialization of our data would be far more important for everyone. And that's just a very public example, I'm sure a lot of important things go on without no one noticing, like they used to bring to light on this show a few years ago.

Nice move there. I read your comment, hence my response. Blame the president constantly being in scandals, not comedians for covering the scandals. Others get wiggle room due to distractions, yes, but that doesn't mean we should take it easy on such an influential person that deserves to be talked about. These things he's making jokes about affect the world, that's why they're being addressed. But you'll probably just find some other typo due to my small screen and not giving a shit to try to invalidate everything I say rather than taking it in. You do you.

Like it was obvious it was about Trump. Maybe instead you should wish that our president stops getting himself involved in scandals, and mistakes so that our conversations can branch out.

That means it is not payment for any specified payment--Your boss is NOT aware of each individual act you do for your monthly salary. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXQuto1fMp4&amp;t=3m15s">3:15</a> pm put paper into copy machine to print out report--Dimwits--your boss is not aware that you did that despite paying you for it as part of your salary. To a billionaire, $130k is like the amount of money your boss paid you to load the copy machine last week. Bullshit indeed.

I don&#39;t even know who any of my great-grandparents are, much less any of their kids (other than the grandparent), or their kids&#39;s kids, or their kids&#39;s kids&#39;s kids. And they&#39;re like, 1/16th genetically similar to you. That&#39;s in the range of the average random person from your ethnic heritage.<br /><br />At the level of 2nd cousin, you&#39;re talking about a few hundred people you&#39;ve never met before in your life and share nothing with.<br /><br />Like, it would only be kinda weird if one of your parents was really close to one of their cousins and so you grew up together with that cousin&#39;s kids...but that&#39;s one connection. There&#39;s a LOT more 2nd cousins than that	UCXV28RVzFuungepa6zY52ew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXV28RVzFuungepa6zY52ew	0

But that&#39;s some manipulative shit. Like, it makes sense for him to be involved with the Mafia Night, when put into the right context. He was considered instrumental in helping bring down the mob.

It's hilarious, especially since Woods used to be a likeable guy, but is now also a rightwing nutjob dickwit. He won an award for that role, which I think set him on the path to douchedom.

While both animals are swift, have long, tubular bodies, their coloring, size at maturity and hunting habits are not the same. Ferrets have been domesticated for over 2,500 years while weasels remain untamed.	UCb95vAMQY7mwEs1BgVJPtjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb95vAMQY7mwEs1BgVJPtjg	0

Others - like Guliani, former and now deceased Mayor of Providence, RI Vincent &quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci. And the list goes on. And it&#39;s not exactly a good thought that as Italian-American&#39;s get older they go down one of two paths - either crazy and quiet and smart. I&#39;m hoping I go down the latter.

Can you account for every payment you’ve ever made for 1/30,000th of your wealth? Would you even notice is 1/30,000th of your wealth went missing? People much less wealthy than Trump have people that write checks on their behalf, and I would be astonished if I found out Trump didn’t.<br /><br />This means it is incredibly likely that Trump has no idea that he reimbursed Cohen for the payment, because he didn’t personally do it. His money reimbursed Cohen, he, most likely, didn’t.	UC8n5yxj83yKptJyUZcu-30w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8n5yxj83yKptJyUZcu-30w	0

Im guessing that fills some other quota for you that lack of women didnt. And of course leftist pundits arent the only biased ones. Many are.

If that's an example of your reliability as a listener, then why should we believe you regarding better news sources? It's also odd that you claim Oliver and others are "biased comedians that push whatever gets them ratings," since (1) you're not privy to their unstated motives and (2) news organizations also employ biased shills and are obsessed with ratings. The Intercept is funded by someone with an agenda, too, and many have commented about the relative lack of women reporters on that site. I like the Intercept, too, but I'd never claim that Glenn Greenwald was free of bias. He's the first to say he *is* biased; his point is that his reporting is also *valid*, since it is meticulously researched and based on fact. Also: the comedians you call "biased" mostly identify as democrats, while many reporters and forum regulars at the Intercept tend to despise democrats. Are you equating democrat affinity with bias, as though it were some anomalous strain, as opposed to, say, right-wing nationalist bias? And what do you make of the fact that many people used to get their news from Jon Stewart in the days when Bush III was pres and most news agencies were in bed with him? What can you say about a comedian at a white house press dinner who told so many truths that reporters all over the country are so furious they're now unwilling to admit they conflated the word *facts* with *fat*?

Taking your tax dollars and making them work for left, since Republicans won't put money into their bullshit. All these news channels just create different takes off of paper news, which is nearly killing the small companies that send actual journalists to provide accurate information.

Clearing that area before an investigation of the steel was itself a crime. Why so overzealous to clear the area before any investigation was done? Big question. His love of the limelight will turn from famous to truly infamous for his part in helping to cover-up the greatest crime on American soil. I&#39;m not religious, but I imagine there is a very, very special place for people like that beyond this one.	UCpVDQOokqDWKWfcOaPpDu6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVDQOokqDWKWfcOaPpDu6A	0

He talks about how Trump and friends are &#39;easily baited into making stupid mistakes&#39;, and says that they should just keep their mouths shut. Yet they still keep making dumbass fuckups and talking about them, over and over again. <br /><br />It&#39;s a long standing custom for lawyers to bluntly refuse to discuss anything concerning pending litigation publicly. It has to be weird to hear your lawyer say &quot;We&#39;re going to win by discussing our strategy in detail on TV dozens and dozens of times, and the defense will play into our hands every time because they&#39;re so stupid they can&#39;t help themselves.&quot;	UCnXLutbZ4I2pBPv3g0kQTMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXLutbZ4I2pBPv3g0kQTMw	0

Trump knew his lie about not knowing wasn&#39;t going to hold up, so he and Rudy concocted the strategy of putting it out on Hannity. Trump tweeted confirmation of the payments the next morning. Then, when the reviews of Giuliani&#39;s performance were horrible, Trump backtracked and threw Giuliani under the bus.

It's pretty unusual to even know who your fourth cousins are. It means you only have great-great-great-grandparents in common, which was probably a century ago. Even second/third cousinhood actually has a fairly low genetic risk; first cousins have a higher risk to the offspring, but not nearly as iffy as parents or siblings. The problem with first cousins mostly arises when you have multiple generations doing it successively, which has always been pretty rare. That would require a pretty small and very isolated population, because humans instinctively avoid inbreeding too much; there's a reason every culture on the planet seems to have some means of tracking their genealogy.

That is provided the pairing only happens ONCE. When you get cousins/ Family members breeding together over and over again like in THAT"s when you the kind of screwed-up inbreeding you would often see in the royal family of Europe. I still find it kind of creepy (no doubt to the cultural norms in which I was raised) but to each their own. That being said, it should be pointed out that cousin incest differs from brother-sister incest and/or parent/child incest. This kind of incest has a MUCH HIGHER risk of causing genetic defects in children. I can probably google some links to studies if anybody is interested.

Look at the habsburgs they married their nieces for something like two centuries before it got back to them but when it did their blood line had deteriorated really badly and the main branch quickly died out. The problems from the first cousin coupling is not big but the risks grows exponentially with every time it's happened in your family, and it takes a long time to come back down again, at least if all the genepool is not that diverse.

He has gotten more and more extreme over the years, but he&#39;s always been inflammatory and quasi-fascist (Stop and Frisk still remains in practice [lived reality despite being declared unconstitutional search and seizure], and disproportionately targets the poor and people of color). He presided over rents getting out of control and poured gasoline on that fire. And he led to the Bloomberg years of ever more gentrification and endless handouts to all real estate developers. I am out of NY but have family there who live month to month. That&#39;s most of NY, and it&#39;s a second-class existence. Oh, and Queens really needs more transportation, not more parks. But everything is done to cater to the Manhattan rich and Brooklyn wannabe rich. <br /><br />John, you didn&#39;t even get into Guiliani&#39;s crossdressing!<br /><br />Also, on 9/11, he was no &quot;great leader.&quot; He used a great tragedy for personal gain. He wasn&#39;t very effective in making our recovery. In some ways, NY is still recovering (and I would say we haven&#39;t recovered in the right way, with retail).<br /><br />I apologize to America for my city dumping Trump and Guiliani on them. They just care about their own enrichment. They have no sense of public service. Guiliani gets off on control, and Trump gets off on money. <br /><br />PS- I would love to meet Billy Eichner. Adore him.	UCodw5POxS0Vt3CQ3WIabIJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodw5POxS0Vt3CQ3WIabIJg	0

I don't think the aim is to desensitize anyone but to remind us of who this man is. And I don't see why it would be more heart wrenching for Ivanka to hear these jokes than to hear her own father's words. He made some very odd comments about her on TV and in different magazines over the years, like this one in Rolling Stone in 2015: "Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father . . . "	UCxzY2GkINnnYw8EwUVj7_Ow	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxzY2GkINnnYw8EwUVj7_Ow	1	UgzURsK_sU1vanb5WzN4AaABAg	JustAVoice

The only good thing he did, as mayor, was clean up Times Square and getting the &quot;squeegee guys&quot; off the street. These were the guys that washed your windshield with dirty water, while stuck at a red light, and then demanded money from the motorist. He is also the moron that moved the city&#39;s terrorist task force operations into the World Trade Center after the first attack. After the 9/11 attacks, the city scrambled to find an alternate location site since their offices were destroyed. His entire life was about being a tough prosecutor, but now is an apologist for Trump. Now Mueller and the FBI are on a &quot;witch hunt&quot;, according to him.

His stop and frisk, his war on the poor, his gestapo like censorship of free speech when he was mayor, the confusion of integrating emergency services which slowed the response to the 9/11 attack... this guy has been hated by every human being who isn&#39;t a Wall Street Banker or MSM brainwashed heartland soccer mom/nascar dad.

No, John Oliver, that is not horsesh--. The number 20% and the personal direct sale verbiage might be an exaggeration, but those whores would do anything for money and power, and they constantly put their influence up for sale. The Clinton Foundation aims "to strengthen the capacity of people to meet global interdependence challenges" in the same way Sandra Bullock and the police navigate the bus bomb in the movie Speed. That's why nobody wanted to believe she was better than Trump. I hate it when comedians force a slam dunk against a chosen target by exaggerating the good in the other side. The American Dream is independent wealth. America acts like Sandra and the cops; as to say, if the American economy goes below 55 mph and people have to pull together and become socially interdependent the world will blow up. Huge military which goes on seek and destroy "humanitarian" missions to blackmail the world into forgiving its spineless lazy debt-ridden indulgence in ego massage.

UgzHcJoVWIHj-PJWYhl4AaABAg.8fxB6vdJXEx8fxY5yUxOA8		11	2018-05-07 17:39:37	Jessica Lee	John Oliver has been a current-events comedian in the U.S. for over ten years, starting at the Daily Show as the "British Correspondent" or sometimes "European Courresponduente", to talk about international news, and also give a useful outsider's perspective on how things work in the U.S. He stayed in the country, married an American (a veteran, which is why he sometimes wears a lapel pin with the logo of her cavalry unit) and is either a legal permanent resident or a naturalized citizen of the United States. Nobody went and got him from the U.K. to make fun of Trump. As for "that other one" Trevor Noah, he was an internationally successful stand-up comic (certainly not a "nobody back home") focused on social issues and current events, who was also brought on to the Daily Show to talk about international and specifically African topics, and also to provide an outsider's perspective on the U.S. It was a bit of a surprise that he became the anchor for the Daily Show, considering he'd only been a correspondent/guest speaker for maybe a year? But where he's from doesn't change anything about what he says about the United States' current events. If anything, he has a less biased perspective as more of an outsider. He has never shied away from criticizing South Africa either, just as John Oliver has never shied away from criticizing the U.K. They've also both talked plenty of times about all the things they love about the United States and what a great country it is... I guess you weren't listening. People from all over the world come to the U.S. for all sorts of reasons, all the time. I know, I know, the jingoistic right-wing folks hate that fact, despite their own parents/grandparents/great-grandparents doing exactly the same thing (with far fewer immigration restrictions to navigate at the time), but we are a nation of immigrants, and immigrants have the same human rights as everybody else. One of the fundamental rights that makes this a FREE COUNTRY is the right to criticize it. Only in North Korea and other oppressive regimes are you not allowed to criticize the country or its leaders. Maybe you should learn to be more comfortable with freedom. Or do you only want to allow immigrants who come in and lick our boots? Under your immigration policy how many years do they have to spend licking our boots and telling us how wonderful we are and thanking us, before they're allowed to talk about current events?

Meanwhile, Mueller hasn&#39;t got a piece on his background once--despite the fact that Mueller&#39;s prosecutorial malfeasance during the Anthrax investigation is well known, and wound up actually killing an innocent man. <br /><br />You&#39;d think all the very enlightened and educated people watching John would at least want a background on the most important part of the investigation--the investigator.

Where are you getting the CFPB? Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, McCabe, Mueller were never part of the CFPB... Really, are you high? The CFPB though is another interesting thing that for some reason was glossed over by the late night comedy crew until Trump. Like the fact that it can get its money directly from the federal reserve without congressional approval. Or the fact that it used the policy of "Regulation by Enforcement"--which is to say it punished people, and THEN made the regulation up based on the enforcement. Which means they were punishing people ex-post facto, which of course is illegal in itself and goes against centuries of common law. But uhh, go on and tell me what I don't know about the CFPB, or what you're ever talking about.

The second guy was also not guilty, but Mueller closed the case quickly once he committed suicide because he needed to bury it. The second man killed himself because he saw how it DESTROYED his colleague. There was ZERO physical evidence against the second man as well but Mueller was willing to hit him with a freight train to distract from the first. His career is filled with these over-reaches, and misconduct. It's genuinely the perfect stuff for Oliver to do a piece on and inform people about.

Instead a wrongly pursued lead led to that person sueing the FBI and winning lots of money. While the actual perpetrator later killed himself while the FBI was preparing warrants to arrest him. All of this was brought up again when Obama planned to keep Mueller after taking over the Presidency from Bush. Stop making up fake shit and passing it off as facts.

If you are as smart as you pretend to be, then you'd fucking know. Most real Trump believers are just as retarded as he is, but then there's people like you. The retards cant really do much about it, they dont have the brains. You appear to have brains, but can't put things in context.* That's pretty vague, Jean. I see a lot of "there are reasons", but then no actual reasons. What I do know is that Mueller has skimmed perilously close to misconduct numerous times in his career. I know there are major ethical concerns about McCabe, Comey and Mueller all knowing each other far more so than they testified to under oath. I do know Mueller and Comey's investigation uses criminal procedural powers (Special Counsel) to investigate a counter intelligence investigation--which has allowed the powers of that office to be used without a crime specified (Which has never happened before in the history of this country. Even Ken Star's ridiculous witch hunt at least put up that pretense. I could explain to you why this is the MOST chilling thing that's happened since the FISA courts rubber stamp expansion in the wake of 9/11, but I doubt you've ever read this far. What we've just done though is give an office the power to investigate people, and not crimes--and that is harrowing on so many levels.) I know that an organization was formed WITHIN the FBI to oppose an elected president, and that organization named themselves Dumbledore's army (I mean...really?) I know two of the main officials within that opposition group were having an affair and knowingly avoided using government communications to prevent FoIA requests, and then the thousands of texts they did make that were applicable were "lost" before they could be delivered to Congress. I know Hillary Clinton bought information from Russian intelligence officials to affect the election--precisely what this witch hunt is all about. I KNOW in 1996, the DNC did literally everything they are accusing Trump of doing...LITERALLY...They had secret meetings with Chinese intelligence agents in the white house, who explicitly agreed to run a media campaign to affect the election and donate large amounts of money in exchange for influence after. In the Congressional investigation https://fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/index.html We found bank records, had RECORDINGS of meetings and even filmed the spies going to the Chinese embassy to drop data off...Literally red handed. THEN Janet Reno fired her OWN prosecutor to prevent investigations, and the FBI is on record saying Clinton/Reno shut down their investigation--in addition, at the time, the DNC and Clintons asserted that none of this was illegal and thus the idea of a special prosecutor was "preposterous". (Its all there in the testimony linked.) I KNOW all this...So yes, Jean, I am pretty well educated. And the thing you're not seeing here is I am the one putting things into context. YOU are the one that doesn't have the context, or precedence of how things work, and are instead relying on people like Oliver to tell you what's bad. And that is the problem. Its a problem because you assume that you're informed..And you assume that because you've got guys like this telling you are. And you're not because they only provide selective information. I'm very Liberal, and I can see this isn't healthy--this is rotten to the core. In a decade Liberals went from being the defender of civil liberties and against the growing intelligence community that was destroying them, to being their biggest cheer leaders and somehow saying they are beyond reproach--all for what? to get Trump? I mean for fuck sake, Jean...You've got a guy, Clapper, on CNN telling people what's what who was caught spying on Congress and then caught under oath lying about it. At the time many of the same pundits taking this man's word as gospel were saying he was everything wrong with the system. So forgive me if I'm blind sided by the huge case of amnesia Trump Hate Syndrome has caused. But I'm not going to make myself dumber just to 'get him'.

I guess I'm feeling a little betrayed, you know? *. Secondly, and more importantly, this show is rife with neoliberalism so what are you really expecting?* Well, given Mr. Oliver's holier than though rhetoric on the admonishment of "fake news"--I guess something better. Don't get me wrong, I'm not even a Trump supporter. I just find the entire Russia investigation to be a disgusting display of partisan politics eroding a lot of civil liberties. Say what you will about Liberal comedians from 20 years ago, yes they were just as partisan--but at least they were on the side of civil liberties. What Ken Star did to subvert various rules was one of the primary sticking points--when the patriot act came out, they went to town on it. These were good things, regardless of sides. Now though...I watch those same comedians in some cases support CIA and FBI misconduct harder than conservatives used to, and champion the erosion of civil liberties to "get trump"...And Trump is right about one thing for sure, this is a witch hunt that is WAY too reminiscent of McCarthy for my taste. That was one of the darkest periods of American history outside slavery, and the fact that we so obliviously charge into repeating it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth...And again, this isn't about Trump. People are being destroyed due to supposed ties with Russia. I work in lobbying, there are over 100 firms working for Russia RIGHT NOW...The media has made something totally normal into something nefarious and used that to selectively bring people to trial in the court of public opinion. The process is simple, take something everyone is involved in but isn't public knowledge specifically--like say if I said people who watch porn are terrible due to X reason. No one really knows who watches porn, but we've all probably watched it. This way I have something over EVERYONE but I can selectively pick who I batter down with it. Classic witch hunting tactics. I mean, again, Hillary Clinton bought information from Russian intelligence to affect the election...In 1996 Bill Clinton invited Chinese Spies to sleep at the white house, who paid him and the DNC and explicitly told him they would affect the election--then Janet Reno fired her OWN prosecutors to stop them from investigating and threatened multiple FBI agents to end the investigation (We know all of this from a Congressional investigation---look it up, the 96 Campaign finance controversy). There was no special prosecutor, because while all of that is bad--it's not illegal, which puts it squarely in the domain of Congressional inquiry. (Note: There was one illegal aspect, since money changed hands, and that was campaign finance--which is why Reno fired her own prosecutor, since she protested ending the investigation.) Now we're here, and look at how selectively people are "guilty" of this (Even though I assure you, people in Washington work with Russian FARA agents EVERY day.) We've had multiple "have you no decency" sir moments, where sitting members of Congress have been accused of being Russian agents for DISAGREEING with their peers. It's disgusting, and I'm tired of it. Its especially bad because the ultimate irony of all this is that the people advocating for more ties to the global community (Globalism, more open borders ect) are the ones who believe somehow Russians having an opinion here is treason...Like what do people even think globalism means? It's very exhausting watching the side you grew up supporting switch on a dime like this for such a petty reasons as "we don't like him". Hell, I don't like Trump, but god damn people, be adults.

I don&#39;t understand this kind of bashing. My grand parents were first cousins, which I do agree is a bad idea because of the high risk of genetic diseases, but with second cousins, guess how much this risks amounts to........... ZERO ! Making fun of marriage between second cousins seems to be funny in American culture, but it has no grounds for such condescendence.

Rudy as a prosecutor was terrible. Rudy loved to Grandstand. He would notify the media that he was going to make a big arrest and do it with an entourage of reporters and cameras only later to have a judge throw out the case due to lack of evidence. Everything he did was to glorify himself but too damn lazy to do the work. He was a terrible mayor.	UCm0luIl6K2fAFMtJdJmCWTg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm0luIl6K2fAFMtJdJmCWTg	0

First off the police and law enforcement *do not* prosecute people. Lawyers either prosecute of defend people. Before political office Rudy served in the Attorney General's office investigating and prosecuting people, mostly grandstanding. As mayor he had the city sue people to stop them from exercising their constitutional rights. Rudy lost every case costing the city in the millions of dollars just so he could get the press coverage. On arresting people. when a prosecutor wants to file criminal charges he then requests that the police go out and arrest them. Rudy would orchestrate the arrest with the press and media present so he can be the spokes person on why they are arresting the individual.

All the mob had to do was watch it and they'd know what to do and what to get rid of. Which is exactly what Trump did both times regarding the Syria attacks. Grandstand to media, say what you want to do, give them enough time to prepare and take action, then attack, and finally take credit for something you didn't do...

Giuliani's grandstanding is in the public record and his convictions are also in the public record. I will also add that Giuliani as mayor used his power to grandstand to go after people who were doing nothing wrong and the taxpayer's expense. He did this all the time. What Giuliani entire strategy is based on being in front of the cameras no matter how. A very good example of how he has this need to be in front of a camera is how he handled leaving his wife and kids. Rudy called a press conference and announced to the world that he is seeking a divorce from his wife who by the way is also his cousin. The only people he did not tell were his wife and kids. They found out about it by watching the news. Rudy then married his mistress. I have no problem with Rudy wanting a divorce but at least tell you family before holding a press conference.

They predicted Hillary winning the popular vote by around 4 points; she won by 2 points, which is about an average inaccuracy that increasing sample size does not necessarily fix. This was showed whether or not the polls were conducted by news stations. The news stations' forecasts were more flawed than the polls. They mistakenly thought that multiple polls showing Hillary winning by several points meant she would do well at the electoral college and that if she won the popular vote she would win states that Democrats usually win; in fact, she lost some states that the Democrats won in 2004. It is understandable why they would think that, but it was excessive confidence in their forecast, which is why better forecasters like five thirty eight put lower confidence levels on forecasts of her winning.

Russia: Michael Flynn was arrested by the FBI because he lied to the FBI about his conversations concerning the release of Russia sanctions with the Russian ambassador. The Don Jr. e-mails detaling how he'd love it "during the summer" if Rob Goldstone released "documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.' that Don Jr. released himself. Link here https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/11/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-email-text.html. Donald Trump fired James Comey and said to a Russian ambassador during a White House meeting that the guy was a "real nutjob" while disclosing private info about iran. Then there's George Papadopolous, the Trump campaign aid who tried to set up contacts with the Kremlin. Also: 4 months after Trump began campaign while Trump was saying that he hasn't talked to Russia in "years" Trump was confirmed to have signed a deal to build a Trump Tower skyscraper in Moscow. Where did that come from? Michael Cohen's e-mails. Here https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-knew-moscow-tower-proposal-campaign-lawyer/story?id=49472342 And also, 19 Russians were sanctioned by the U.S., 13 of which Mueller indicted because of the Russia scandal. The Nixon Watergate investigation took 2 years until the House Judiciary Committee passed three articles of impeachment to the House floor to begin a vote that never occurred because Nixon resigned. If the FBI released info on every step they took in their investigation, this investigation would take forever. If you truly want to discuss the worth of this investigation, how about we all wait until the investigation is finished.

For all we know this investigation will go on for another two years just so left feels like they didn't lose. There was no collusion and the only thing they have on Trump is that he fucked a pornstar...When it shouldn't matter cause he wasn't president when it happened...

Currently 60% to 70% of the country at any given time has some left leaning views. That's 100 - 200 millon people. To believe that all of those people can be viewed through the same lens because of the way they believe there is a better way to run this country is ridiculous.

Remember, tons of young women and some men look up to Kim/kanye, and they tend follow whatever they do. The left doesn't want people thinking for themselves, they want you to be progressive and accepting towards everything and everyone, even if its not morally correct. Yet look how accepting they are when someone of their own party speaks out...They instantly try to ruin his career and ship him to a mental hospital. Dont take my word for it, look how the left treats anyone who doesn't agree with them. Its sick.

But he's a public figure, and it's publicly available information, they're just aggregating it and putting it on display, so people know (and making jokes, so that it's entertaining instead of horrifying).

He put laws into place that sucked the life out of NY. Besides all the horrible quality of life laws, no one forgets how he messed up Park Avenue which gloriously failed. Horrible, horrible mayor, Aggressive cops, all the wonderful street vendors, gone. Oh, but 9/11. 9/11 was a godsend, for him.

Being able to get married isn't a "special right" it's the same right you have. That IS equality. The protection to not be fired from a job because of sexual orientation protects straight people too. The idea is that you can't fire someone because of their orientation, it doesn't specify which type of orientation. I never understood how the party of small government could support the regulation of our bedrooms. Since you didn't answer my biblical question I'll assume you have no answer and have just embraced the hypocrisy of the Religious Right. Ps. you do hate gays if you use the word "faggot" like you do, so maybe you should just be honest about your hatred if you're going to keep saying it.

UgzVlK8J8QEctELWbMF4AaABAg.8fx0M2NmAwf8g-z58BK4Ci		0	2018-05-09 01:41:54	Ali Y	I love you know why I care about this issue more than me. Let me try re-explaining it to you. I am gay. For literally DECADES the republican party stood in the way of marriage equality and basic civil rights on the grounds of family values, aka biblical values. Marriage is "between one man and one woman", how many fucking times did I have to hear that? Still have to hear that. The republican party's platform TODAY still calls for the overturning of marriage equality, still defines marriage as between one and one woman. Now suddenly the face of the republican party is caught cheating (again, this is not new by the way), with not just anyone, but a fucking sex worker, paid her off to be quiet and they are just fine with it. My relationships are a slap in the face to the bible dooming me to hell, but his are meh, totally fine. 99% of progressives do not care who he fucks, how many he fucks, or where he fucks as long as it's consenting adults he's fucking. If the pee tape exists, I literally do not care. He can do whatever he wants. What I care about is the GOP who have sold their soul to him and his ideals. The GOP can never run on family values again after electing this guy. Ever. All progressives are pointing out is the enormous hypocrisy, to help nail the coffin shut on the religious right. Explain to me how 80% of evangelicals could vote for someone who has been married 3 times, cheated on every one of those wives, has children with multiple people, but can still call for LGBT discrimination in the name of "family values"? They can take their family values and shove it. Sincerely, 50 years' worth of gay people who simply wanted to marry their partner.

Yes, he handled 9/11 well, but that was it, prior to 9/11 the city hated him. He&#39;s like the school bully who wins the big game... yes he won the big game but that doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a bully.

He didn't really do anything, it was the amazing jobs of the 1st responders that he covered himself in. They made him look good, and he took complete advantage of the the situation and peoples grief.

They have doubled and tippled down to people on his bullshit so many times that it's like being the spouse of an abusive husband. They know it's wrong. They have to. How could they not? The thing is that they've spent so much time defending the piece of shit, that they don't want to deal with people's bullshit or their own heartache, once they finally admit what's wrong. They know once they open that door and let the emotions of being treated so poorly in and they pride they'll lose from risking their reputation on someone who turned out to be a garbage human being, that it's going to be a torrent they might never get over. So they keep ignoring the obvious, trusting a liar over facts, and find any excuse to act like they're the superior human who knows something no one else does. Ya know, like their supreme commander Trump does.	UCz_iJRMSiWNY5jC0GnAZFRg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_iJRMSiWNY5jC0GnAZFRg	1	Ugw4O8RsRkrVCpbGU1F4AaABAg	MythicTyrant

I thought I made that clear when I said that I should have phrased my comment differently. Just because someone is trying to make a joke doesn't mean that the premise of the joke is necessarily accurate. In order to find a joke funny it helps if you accept the premise. The premise John Oliver's joke was technically true, he did call jared disposable. However it missed the forest for the trees by failing to mention that, to the extent that he called Jared disposable, he also called John Oliver himself disposable as well as every male in John Oliver's audience. It is an even more ludicrous statement than Oliver made it out to be and I fail to see how ignoring the full scope of Giuliani's statement made Oliver's joke necessarily funnier than it would have been had he characterized the statement accurately.

Ok, let me introduce you to the concept of syllogism: Jared is a man; men are disposable; thus, Jared is disposable. This is called logic, and it's a fair inference based on factual premises (in this case). Secondly, whether Rudy meant Jared was disposable from a public relations point of view or literally disposable is IRRELEVANT because Oliver is a COMEDIAN. Do you know what comedians do? They make jokes, they make jokes about things they see and things you say. That's comedy. You're not as insightful as you think you are and your arguments are still as pathetic as they obviously seem	UC7e-dusVUuMxB9sbgdQKPvw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7e-dusVUuMxB9sbgdQKPvw	1	Ugzb6ON3yxsT1d-hPA14AaABAg	Richard Blum

Men are disposable, Jared is a man, and is therefore less of a concern for him when it comes to media attacks than his sister, who is a woman and therefore presumably not disposable. My response was aimed at how John Oliver framed Giuliani's words as though he had called a specific human being disposable when, in actuality, he had called half of the human race disposable. It is a subtle difference in language but a monumental difference in meaning. I thought that was an interesting, and somewhat telling, oversight on John Oliver's part. Perhaps I should have phrased it, "he didn't JUST call Jared disposable." So as to be more clear. Thanks for your insightful response.

Research it in studies that have not been sponsored by any food/nutrition institute (that is, studies done by scientists at academic research institutes, not food scientists with corporate sponsors). While the Goldwater rule prohibits diagnosing people one has not personally treated (it is unethical; additionally, I am but a humble aspiring health writer, not a clinician) ...both exhibit signs of dementia-like illness due to excessive aspartame consumption, especially the aggressiveness, poor decision-making/executive functioning and impulsivity, and, in Trump, excessive visceral fat and fluctuating energy levels.

It sounds like a hit piece from top to bottom, which is very unusual for Last Week Tonight. Now, we&#39;ve always known that LTW is pro-Democrat (which for me is fine, as if I was a US citizen, I&#39;d be a Democrat, too). However, it has been very nuanced and well-researched. <br /><br />What does this video show us instead? It starts from the latest Trump scandal (which, when compared to the Russia scandal, to the Iran issues and to a trade war is very much negligeable, UNLESS there is proof that campaign money were used), but then completely abandons it and focuses on Rudy Giuliani, who stepped down as a mayor in 2001 (17 years ago). Why do you hold such a grudge? Then mentions that he married his cousin - why is this relevant to US political life? Sure, it may be relevant to some small degree, but it&#39;s been repeated throughout the show. Then talks about what jobs he had after the end of his career to mock him? Why is that so bad? At least, he continued working. <br /><br />I am very disappointed with this episode. And note that, when I started watching, I told myself &quot;okay, Democrats have had it out for Rudy Giuliani for decades, let&#39;s see what they hate about him so much&quot; - and I come out thinking &quot;oh, they just don&#39;t like him because he is Republican&quot;. The ONLY political issue that I can understand is police brutality, which is a problem - but this occupied a mere 30 seconds of the video. RG marrying his cousin takes like 1/3 of the episode, but police brutality - that&#39;s 30 seconds? <br /><br />If we were drinking at a party and you were telling me all this over a glass of whiskey, I&#39;d be laughing. But this isn&#39;t the quality journalism of Last Week Tonight that I am used to.	UCC2ww8cp4IIidQ4wjBVrWeQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2ww8cp4IIidQ4wjBVrWeQ	0

I thought that this was supposed to be a late night humor show, and all they do is talk about Trump. Go back to your fucked up British country you piece of fucking shit loser. I think it’s because of the arrogance and stupidity of someone like you that America decided to run the British out of our country in the 1700s. And now Britain is so fucked up that they have more police officers enforcing social media laws, then actual criminal street crimes. Because of pussies like this that would rather hide, then go out and fight for their country against the surging crime rate in Britain	UCo5HUbPDyBTeQxLEhYCD2TA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo5HUbPDyBTeQxLEhYCD2TA	0

It&#39;s not the healthiest option, but as long as the family tree before doesn&#39;t have in-family marriage it should be fine.<br />Why is that important? Because it&#39;s not a real flaw to one&#39;s character. It doesn&#39;t make him a worse person. It&#39;s one level above pointing someone ugly and laugh at his stupid face. It&#39;s barely a joke...

Granted, he inherited a crime infested city from Dinkins, and his over-powered police tactics worked to eliminate the squeegee men. Policemen would be recognized as heroes for anything large or small, good or bad. They were untouchable under Giuliani. They could be recognized for capturing an ant for bullying another ant. Jay walkers would be issued summons. Those were the years.	UCYJFksENDxLd1nVFZNasf-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJFksENDxLd1nVFZNasf-g	0

Example he said the confession we all heard come out of Donald Trump&#39;s thinking mouth on that Hollywood bus interview, was nothing more than locker room talk! Not according to criminal psychologist brain specialist leading physicians, what Donald Trump confessed to was much more consistent with a jailhouse confession from one inmate to another&#39; or a prison reminiscence from one convict to another who are living out there sentencing in protective custody. Any other prosecutor in the world would consider a confession, that coincides with 14 defendants complaint echoing with the audiotape confession. Open and shut case. And you wonder why America has the highest violent crime rate drug alcohol dependency in the world!

I refuted your logic about making something illegal you are grossed out by. Now personally, my stance is to not interfere with the general relationship of consenting adults, unless abuse happens. Now that doesn't mean that I want "all" incest to be legal, because incest as a term describes many different situations, including the relationships between DIRECT relatives like siblings or parents and children. Now I think there might be an essential ableism in specifically critisizing how high the chance for disabbility in offspring from siblings is, but I guess I can somewhat understand that argument. Way more important an argument against direct relative incest is however the power dynamics at work in many of these relationships. Especially between parents and their children (who we will assume to be above the age of consent in this example, else it would be less about incest and more about child abuse). In these cases we acknowledge that the people are not able to make a completely free and informed decision on engaging with their parents, as they have power over them. Similar to how teachers are not allowed to date their students. That would be my main reason for not universally allowing "all" incest, and I almost feel a bit strawmanned here because I obviously did not advocate for that, as I think none of these situation likely affected Giuliani and his cousin. Now they may, but this wasn't brought up as the butt of the joke in this segment, only their relation to each other was, so I'm assuming this was the only factor. I'm merely laying this out here to show you, that "gross out" is not a good factor for a moral code, as many people are different. Romantic and sexual relationships with children for instance are not morally condemning or illegal because children are gross, they're illegal because children suffer from the above mentioned power dynamics in relation to adults, as well as not being able to give informative consent. All these things are valid points, and you are absolutely allowed to not want to engage in incest with anyone, and you're perfectly fine to critique aspects of it, but please don't justify it by saying "it's icky".

By that logic, all incest should be legal as well, no? As long as theyre consenting adults? To have a blood relationship, there's something stomach churning about that. Like oh, let's go visit our shared grandma, ughhh. Yikes. I guess this happens pretty often in the south but not really on the west coast even though we accept a lot so I'm not used to it. Caught me off guard when someone from as large of a state as new york found his second cousin, small world of they truly didn't know. If they didn't then its much more excusable than family members growing up together and being together. My state is pretty small in population but it's virtually unheard of here. I mean I totally disagree with a lot of US laws as I'm pretty liberal and so is my state. Recreational weed is legal & this is the only state with legalized prostitution which is just fine. Idk call me crazy but I draw the line with hooking up with family 🤷	UCMs011gHSR_TJ-ox0LkdnRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMs011gHSR_TJ-ox0LkdnRw	1	UgweqW-cNjQTVlvQtTJ4AaABAg	The Snarky Lesbian

And I'm not sure how German porn plays into this, I don't know what specifically you are refering to.

I won't judge the love between two consenting adults. I find the idea of being with most people kinda gross, but I wouldn't take it away from people at that rate. And I don't know if I feel like any US state's laws are a good indicator of what should and shouldn't be morally acceptable. Though I general I don't find "laws" to be the best authority to determine a moral code. See marihuana rights.

First cousins share like 12.5% of dna so there's a smaller chance of children being born with illness than with siblings but it's still creepy even when children aren't involved. First and second cousins are allowed to marry and/or cohabitate in certain states but also very looked down upon. I live in Nevada where both marriage and a relationship are illegal which is saying something since most things are accepted in this state.

My first cousins, and some of my second ones, are close enough that I have the same feelings for them as if they were siblings. Small comunity and all, I even went to school with third cousins of mine. I could NOT, EVER see any of them as possible romantic or sexual partners. Now, for cousins who barely knew each other growing up and don't have the same family closeness, I can accept the idea.

I.e. the &#39;social stops&#39; we&#39;ve all incorporated over the years that keep us from saying the mean, hurtful things we&#39;re actually thinking. We have these both to protect those we love from our random painful truths, and also to protect our interests when dealing with others who can influence our fortunes and that we don&#39;t want to offend (to their faces, at least). Many a person known for their &#39;niceness&#39; has fallen victim to this tendancy in their later years. In general, they are completely unaware of this change in their interactions with others. Besides a greater tendancy to selfishness, we are all at risk as we get along in years. sigh (Couldn&#39;t be a more deserving victim than Rudy, tho&#39;, and his pal the prez).

I fucking hate Trump and that's why I'm so sick of hearing about Stormy Daniels and Russia. Trump supporters are never going to be persuaded on his moral short comings. Either they ignore it or they say he's a changed man. Yes, It's shocking but talking about it for months and months is going overboard. And with Russia, the msm and dems are obsessed and basically want war for something that hasn't been proven and probably won't lead anywhere. Watch secular talk if you and you'll see the way the media ignores certain issues and has a neutrality bias. And many dems vote with Trump on issues and then say how they resist him.

The media is obsessed with the Stormy Daniels story because it's fucking crazy that a president cheated on his wife with a porn star and paid for her silence (and Stormy is good at promoting herself). They aren't "obsessed" with the Russia story, tho ~ that's a story that keeps coming back on its own with new weird and damning evidence and we're all wondering what the hell is waiting for us when it's all said and done. And if you haven't noticed, Trump's "issues of substance" are incredibly controversial. Stop trying to fool yourself. It's pathetic watching people like you contort themselves to fit Trump's dick in their mouths.

It&#39;s private life. Shouldn&#39;t even be mentionned.<br />Unless, I don&#39;t know, maybe he had himself something to say about who should marry whom, like gay people perhaps ? In that case, his marriage is fair game. Even if it was a fifth cousin thrice removed, I&#39;d find a way to find it weird and incestuous and mock it, just because.<br />And I&#39;m saying that having had grand-parents who were second or third cousins.

We have our own s...t, to deal with. Italy, Hungaria, Poland to name a few. And many Europeans are not feeling in any way superior. We know better. Europe nursed Hitler, for f...k's sake. And there is no avoidance, over here about the issues pleaguing our own lives. So it is not avoidance. We have poiticians who behave worse than trump does, perhaps. Berlusconi comes to mind. And there are a bunch of anti-European politicians cashing their fat pay-check from the EU, just because they were elected, when their agenda is about destroying whatever achievement the EU has managed so far. Just to tell you that eu has a whole bunch of issues to deal with. So it is not a question of false equivalence. Was never about that. Just concern and worry. Even in my country, we have our sad share of rogue and self-serving politicians. So I think comments that you seem to feel are demeaning to your country are not. Just a shared concern and worry about how one can feel being lied to and manipulated. Same here, same in the US. I do not put everyone in the same bag. But I feel the need to call for vigilance. Trump was elected with lies and BS. Worse than Mrs. Clinton. And common sense should prevail. I still feel that she would have made a better president, despite her baggage. Because she was real, warts and all. Whereas Trump sold himself as a fix man, and lied his head off. Much more than she did. Regards.

The kind of bias their liberal media portrays (Rudy and Trump fucking Ivanka? seriously?). It may be funny for the liberals but imagine how the other half of the country that supports Trump will feel. Anybody who criticises Trump becomes a hero (e.g. Comey) and anybody who appreciates Trump becomes a villan (e.g. Kanye). Anyway fuck it - great entertainment for the rest of us.

We loathe radicalism in all its forms, and especially regarding matters that deal with women's rights to own their life and body. Your comment seems so preposterous, it almost seems like wilfull disinformation. So, you are not stating a fact, just what seems like a prejudiced and anti-left opinion. Or show your evidence.

The Catholic Church apparently thought it was significant, as they granted an annulment of the marriage because they didn't seek special dispensation before marrying. And Wiki says they had known each other since childhood, but claim they thought were third cousins. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard to check and realize you had a common set of great grandparents.

(thank you wikileaks) Are we supposed to forget that Obama said that the election was unhackable BEFORE the election while they were stuffing ballots for Hillary, then when Trump made her feel the Bern afterwards they crowed about how it was all hacked? We forgetting how hacking, turned into Russia collusion, turned into a nothing burger? Forgetting the 2+ billion dollars that were &quot;donated&quot; to Hillary before the election from the richest people in the US and around the world?<br /><br />Yeah, I am so worried that some clown named Rudy has been hired to go on the news and honk his red nose so that the mainstream media can point and laugh, while Trump is busy threatening China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. And I&#39;m not only amazed that we&#39;re not in WW3, but that it also seems to be working for the US.<br /><br />I was promised nuclear war if Trump was elected, I stocked up on ammo and freezedried food. Instead of trying to hook up with survivors after the apocalypse, I&#39;m snacking on Mountain House while camping and keeping my weapons zeroed on the range. I was promised argmageddon, and instead I&#39;m getting the lowest unemployment numbers in decades. If A New Morning in America is what the end of the world looks like, I hope Trump get&#39;s elected for a second term.

Rudy won&#39;t be hurt by any of this as America doesn&#39;t care to nor judge anyone based off of lunacy, stupidity, incompetence nor any other inherent flawed character traits over the long term. They only care about perceived success/power/fame/wealth no matter how it was acquired. This perversion of values has resulted in the unfathomable success of such an immense number of substandard humans that it may have actually reversed the tide of evolution though it sure proves it is the &quot;land of opportunity&quot; as a result for better or worse.

As long as you can deal with the stink, so-so liter box use, and kleptomania, they are wonderful. Also, ferret-proofing a house is a life long affair. It&#39;s amazing what these little nuts get into, for better or worse.	UCT9UsA_O-0jjzvXTVid9a4Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9UsA_O-0jjzvXTVid9a4Q	0

Literally have 4 boys and 1 girl and my alpha will not go in the little normal ferret sized ones. You need those ones that reach a foot across. Just get a plastic container for storage and cut it to fit. That's what I did. I also have ferrets that don't always use the paper I put down for them, but persistence and constant praise and watching them for the first couple of minutes in areas they love to hang out in has curbed even the most infrequent mistakes. Also if you have a laminate floor totally try to get them to go in there. Even if they miss the papers, it's so much easier than cleaning the carpet.

They do have their own smell (as do all animals - ever walk into a multi-cat or dog home), but it isn’t strong or pervasive in my experience. Even when I had a horde of 5 (boys, no less!) everyone who walked into my apartment would comment about the lack of smell...and they lived in our dining room. Hell, I had a female w in tact scent glands and the only time she stunk was when she released them (fucking horrid stench, tho). I change their bedding (old towels, beds and hammocks) every few days, scrub them in a bath with cheap ass Palmolive every other month and give em a daily wipe with a wet washcloth. No traditional litter; we use newspaper. My son’s bedroom was far funkier than the bedroom my last 2 ferrets currently occupy. I have noticed that females tend to be better with the litter box than the males. Observation and many litter boxes outside the cage help...sometimes. :) They’re all thieves. I’ve even caught them dragging one of their cage-mates into a closet to “hide”. Had a female, Dylan (cage-mate was Bob!) who taught me all about ferret-proofing. She once climbed a wool trench coat to get to the shelf above (6’ high) where I kept my laundry detergent. She escaped multiple “made for ferret” cages to the point that she and Bob became free-range for a couple of years. After I came home and found her stuck halfway down between a cabinet and wall (having been there long enough to poo)...well, we found a cage that worked. She would climb our dining room chairs and push the raisin box off the table. Big, dopey Bob, waiting below, would frantically hide as many raisins as possible b/f they were caught. Damn, I still miss her. ~wipes tear away~ Okay, ferret babbling - my apologies.	UCJsLg-QpJK6wHOQakDpl8LQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJsLg-QpJK6wHOQakDpl8LQ	1	Ugyv__IxR_RLM00DW1p4AaABAg	C. Roman

His work putting a stop to the rampant insider trading of the S&amp;L and Junk Bond scams of the 80&#39;s still resonates through Wall Street today. You can check out Giuliani on &quot;Ethics in America&quot; with CBS doyenne Fred Friendly engaging in some truly remarkable debates. That is the Rudy Giuliani I know: believe it or not: he really really knows what he&#39;s doing, and I trust him completely.

Rudy Giuliani is a man who proves that sometimes, awful people in charge are exactly what is needed for the betterment of all. Having lived in NYC through Dinkins, this city was an abomination when Giuliani took over in 1994. The crime, the garbage, the public transportation, the drugs &amp; prostitution, the destitution, etc, I cannot understate how horrible it was; to put it simply, typically liberal NYC was desperate enough to elect its first Republican mayor in 30 years. Giuliani did the impossible in those first 4 years, and fixed the unfixable city. No doubt, he ran this city like a dictator and imposed the equivalent of marshal law; no one ever really confused him for being a &quot;soft touch&quot;, that&#39;s for sure. But what he did was both tough to bare, and absolutely 100% necessary for the survival &amp; renaissance of this city. This city ran smoother than words can describe. NYC today would not look remotely like it does today w/o Giuliani. All that does not even begin to mention his role in 9/11 btw. Also, in 2001, most people wanted him to rescind his earlier imposed mayoral term limits to be mayor another 4 years, but he refused; the fact that it was even entertained was why he got some flack toward the end of his tenure. Giuliani is a man who people should hope to God not to have power when things are running really good, and should beg to have in power when the world is on fire. It is because of him that 17 years since he left office, people like John Oliver can even have a studio on the Upper West Side, where they look back &amp; derisively joke how crazy, horrible, and unethical a man Giuliani has always been, or poke fun at his multiple marriages or marrying his 2nd cousin (way to brush off that old chestnut of a low-blow, btw). Giuliani is and always will be a bad man; but he was a fantastic mayor in a time we needed one most. That is opposed to Dinkins and his old campaign coordinator (and current NYC mayor) De Blasio, who seem like nice enough guys; only currently, I have garbage once again going uncollected, poor and mentally-sick individuals urinating randomly on the street on my way to work, and subways &amp; buses that don&#39;t run. But yeah, &quot;boooooo!!&quot; to Giuliani, right?	UCj27X9POxzmWsifme6AeL2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj27X9POxzmWsifme6AeL2g	0

They&#39;ve lost faith with Limbaugh and Jones. And all I have to do....is get them to watch one LWT episode. I need a vehicle to illustrate what&#39;s fucked up with the GOP platform right now. They&#39;re smart fucking people. They dealt with me as an adolescent; they cant be all bad. But they have some awful worldviews and I really hope your show can help. At the very least, I need them to understand why I believe and feel the way I do. The old &quot;if you&#39;re young and not a liberal, you don&#39;t have a heart; if you&#39;re old and not a conservative, you don&#39;t have a brain.&quot; line I think is horseshit. So this is a waaaaay lengthy version of saying 1) thanks, 2) don&#39;t ever quit, please, and 3) there&#39;s far more people who agree/concur than you may realize.

As long as you act ethically and act in your client&#39;s best interests, there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong even with defending child rapists. Conversely, even if you&#39;re representing an orphanage, violating attorney ethics should still be held against you.

After 9/11 happened the REST of the US praised him but everyone in the outer boroughs knew him for what he was. Which is WHY the trump presidency comes as a shock to New Yorkers still, because we&#39;ve dealt WITH trump and his insanity for an enormous amount of time, and to see him be elected president because people believed he had morals and that he would change the US for the better was laughable because people only knew trump as a man on TV while we knew him as a racist bankrupt idiot who did anything for attention.

No, I'd say they were equally corrupt given the -giant fucking thing with the emails- which proved once and for all that if you are big enough, and the democratic party backs you enough, you dont go to jail for anything short of point blank recorded murder. Donald Trump won because we as a country got collectively tired of the policies of republicans and democrats. The republicans had the same old line, but the democrats refused to be the party of the people, continuing to push socialism which we all know would kill us all. They lost, because they stopped being reasonable. End of bloody story. You wanna make sure Donald Trump never happens again? Make sure the Democrats become the party of the people, stop pushing insane and quite frankly idiotic social constructs, stop pushing socialism, and bring back moderates and classical liberals. Stop being dumb, in other words. I dont like Donald Trump or half of his principles but I have no other choice to support him given his opposition, and theirs.

Much much much much much much much better than DT I mean sure Bernie Sanders was much better than Hilary. But republicans and sexist DT managed to successfully really muddy Hilary's name, but most of it was vague BS. Sure her personality and methods are of a career politician(and hardly the only one) , but at least she's competent, smart, open to others opinions, has a heart and is not super corrupt compared to DT. You can see it even now, DT is still as of not that long ago using Hilary as a punching bag as a distraction from his sins. Since as long as republicans have a "evil" democrat to mindlessly hate and vote against, republicans don't seem to give a shit about who they vote into office and support in general. as long as that shit has a republican label.

Germany was bankrupting itself and overtaxing it's citizens trying to pay war reparations and the Nazis promised a means to real change, while providing a scapegoat to blame all the problems on. The scapegoat part is also reminiscent of the Nazis, so you're still right. Just don't be one of those people yelling "TRUMP IS AMERICA'S HITLER!" because that automatically loses you any debate you participate in.

All I have ever seen of Trump is exactly what you've told us and even with all the stupid pomposity of 'The Apprentice' (which I spent screaming "He's a liar, cheater, bankrupt" at the TV) it was incredible to me that people thought he was some kind of rich celebrity instead of what he is (a debauched self-aggrandizing dead-beat keeping afloat on Daddy's money and dirty loans.) But most of all I wondered wat New Yorkers thought about him	UCub0rhuZ8FSB8XmNHdMrjIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCub0rhuZ8FSB8XmNHdMrjIg	1	UgyXv9Jp6UTFQBF1G314AaABAg	The Modern Investor

This is what I gathered in like 45min over 3-4 pro-Trump and Q-anon videos: https://i.imgur.com/V8dwUjx.jpg But I'll still address your claims despite the blatant ad-hominems from tolerant, anti-hate speech and inclusive left. Where is the problem with the so called "white nationalists"? And that by itself is a racist thing to say by the way. So congratz you just played yourself. You shown how you project your racism and all other shit onto others, which is a classic left tactic :) The "shithole countries" is a baseless claim. No evidence of that. And even if he did say that, I and anyone from one of the "shithole countries" would agree with that, and so would most Americans. Which is why people run from those countries to the USA and people from USA don't run to those countries. You might not like the tone of it, but it's the truth and anyone that's not in denial knows this. But you left are using that as your weapon. And it's a crappy weapon :) No, he said that about ILLEGAL immigrants. Not even a nice try. You don't get to say a thing about providing evidence. You showed none, but you twist words to suit your left agenda. Next fake account! Boom!

They basically said the only reason they picked trump was because he was cheap to get and because they thought no one would actually believe he was a competent business person. The whole show was meant to be a bit of a joke/absurd, which is understandable because no competent business person would hire employees that way! He'd declared bankruptcy so many times no US bank would trust him with money, so he was dealing with sketchy former USSR oligarchs to get finances and lo and behold he doesn't want Mueller looking at his finances, it's a "red line" for him. One of the previous winners of The Apprentice said after his "job/prize" he'd never work for Trump again if he had the choice, lol.

Add to that how horrible Hillary is as a person and was as a candidate, and the stage is set for disruption by a populist. This is not unprecedented. If you ditch the biased lens, you'll see pretty clearly that this is the result of the Democrats' adoption of far-left/borderline-neo-Marxist stances and the corruption of the party under Hillary's auspices.

Most people are uninformed and only do what others do to go with the flow. Most people are stupid, plain and simple.

Also, at the time the NDSAP was already coercing people to vote for them. FYI: Just trying to explain reasons a German citizen might have in the 1930s to vote that way. I do not support the ideology in any shape or form.	UCW7Uc7p5LPzNDakgcsoc9hQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW7Uc7p5LPzNDakgcsoc9hQ	1	UgyXv9Jp6UTFQBF1G314AaABAg	The Modern Investor

Something not really talked about. The reduction of crime in NYC was primarily on so-called "quality of life" crimes. Sure, tourists got mugged less, but organized crime and corruption was still very prevalent. Also, incidents of police brutality increased. There was a decrease in murder, but that seemed to be a national trend through the 90's as the US economy was improving.

Like, even if they were both aware of their familial relationship, that&#39;s still a consensual relationship between two adults, and thus pretty well morally neutral. Running on the implication that incest is &quot;gross&quot; is pretty ignorant and surface-level for this kinda show, don&#39;t you think?

I think as far as the law goes, it's only illegal to marry first cousins (if the law is there at all), but I would agree with you that it's best to avoid marrying/procreating with second cousins. With third cousins it gets tricky because it's too far to keep track of. If we want to outlaw marrying second and third cousins, communities will need to start becoming pretty meticulous about family trees. Most people in America seem to have never even met their second cousins, let alone third cousins. They probably don't even know who these third cousins are, so that they can avoid them. Even in my community which takes family tree very seriously, I've only met like 5% of all my third cousins and that was also only in one or two large family gathering occasions.

And when I explain it to them (children of your parents' cousins), they say they don't know if they even have any or that they've never met their parents' cousins or their children. So, I'd buy Giuliani's excuse. Doesn't seem like a stretch to me. (I'm of South Asian descent and I've even met some third cousins - i.e. grandchildren of my grandparent's cousins...we take family trees really seriously yo.)

But no, rudi is out-&amp;-about on his own – intellectually unfettered, but mentally enfeeble. <br /><br />Hey!

Second cousin would be related through great-grandparents. That is, one of their 16 (8 each) great-grandparents was the same person. So they are 1/16th genetically the same, more or less (allowing for gender and gene recombination). So yeah, pretty closely related.

And when I explain it to them (children of your parents' cousins), they say they don't know if they even have any or that they've never met their parents' cousins or their children. So, I'd buy Giuliani's excuse. (I'm of South Asian descent and I know my third cousins - i.e. grandchildren of my grandparent's cousins...we take family trees really seriously yo.)

Although, i think in the show he eventually cracked down on 'Non-fat yoghurt' businesses. So even in the show he was a hardliner, nice bit of profiling.

That would be like your kid marrying the kid of your first cousin, okay, still a little bit too close for comfort, but let&#39;s be accurate here. But Giuliano is still a creep just the same...

Boob, no, it does not fit the definition of incest which is "sexual relations between a parent, child, sibling, or grandchild." Not even first cousins meet that definition. Yes, there is a danger of congential defects due to inbreeding, but it is not illegal. I am not defending it, just complaining that John Oliver was using hyperbole when he claimed Giuliani was married to his first cousin. Hmmm, I just listened to the video again, and this tie I heard Oliver say SECOND cousin. I don't know why I thought I heard first cousin the first time. But actually SECOND cousin is not as close a relationship as FIRST cousin. Yes, it's weird. Apologies to Oliver for my mishearing him.

Diana, that's a possibility, I suppose, but in Giuliani's case he married the daughter of the first cousin of his father or mother (I don't know which one). That makes them SECOND cousins, not first cousins.	UC1rEiuXc01lWrSa5CpR5_dw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rEiuXc01lWrSa5CpR5_dw	1	Ugz0bm_dgBl11Xgzi8Z4AaABAg	Stuart M.

Some people also _don't._ So one would be telling the truth to say that people notice, as _you_ did, but one would also be telling to truth to say that people _don't_ notice.

Socialism itself is nothing more or less than the horrifying concept that workers should be allowed to own their own means of production. (Horrifying because it strips control from the rightfully ruling owner caste and gives it to what would otherwise be happy little wage-slaves so they can work for themselves instead of someone else and receive more than a fraction of the actual value of their labor.)

It used to be the slogan of the Dutch Libertarian Party couple decades ago (in Dutch then of course). Not that they invented it. It is a generic libertarian slogan. Libertarians do "hate", but very little. Libertarians hate forcing people or force in general. Sort of like Buddhists. (I often ask haters to try to open their mind a little bit and try to see libertarians and minarchists as Buddhists, since we both are against force and aggression, but strangely and inconsistently, libertarians get a lot more hate than buddhists do...) _Choosing masters every few years doesn't make you free_, is another generic libertarian quote, for example. But perhaps you should take a look at some of the links first, before you judge and throw around fallacies and preconceptions. And again, try to open your mind and think out of the box.

Trump doing things like spending so much time at Mar-A-Lago that he started calling it the southern White House is funny in a sad way, until you realize he's doing it for a direct personal profit. But that's just what we should have expected when less than half the country decided to elect a businessman who, credit where credit is due, did grow the wealth he inherited...by exploiting "not right, but not illegal" loopholes and doing things like convincing people to give him money for a fake university. And that's without getting into the corruption of his administration at large. Pence spending taxpayer money to fly out to a football game explicitly so he can walk out at the beginning of the game (and sure, he's welcome to protest the NFL...but he should do it on his own dime), multiple department heads spending government money on furniture that is impossibly expensive, a head of the EPA that hires personal acquaintances and gives them massive raises then pretends he had nothing to do with it. Trump actually bragged at a victory rally that "drain the swamp" wasn't something he was interested in, just something he said because people reacted well to it (that one is actually hilarious to watch because you can see the moment his mind catches up to his mouth and he starts walking it back like "oh...but now I DO care about it.") Trump should have "buyer beware" tattooed on his head as a warning so people are reminded what kind of man they're dealing with at all times. A flim-flam man.

Thanks to Trump, white radicals are becoming bolder. Remember the bar shooter in Kansas, the train stabber and Oregon, the school shooter in Florida? Trump always said you can never solve the problem unless you name the enemy. Then why does he refused to name America's greatest enemy: Radical White Extremism. 300 hundred years of their continuous onslaught, and Trump refuses to deal with them. Instead he would rather scapegoat Muslims Mexicans and "shithole" countries instead of focusing on this countries real problems.

It is ALREADY proven that his tax reform is not for the lower class (when he said it will benefit EVERYONE), will bloat the debt by trillions of dollars, his phony "wiretap" affair which cost money, cutting stuff off for veterans, schools, medicaid, allowing mentally unstable people easier access to guns, heck even the "Mexico will pay for the wall" was a lie. And his golfing (which he criticized Obama for) already cost MILLIONS. Thank you for proving how far up your ass your head is.

As usually happens if you pay, the Blackmailer has come back for more. The difference here is you can do illegal stuff as long as it is against Trump. If she Blackmailed John Oliver, he would be reporting the Whore&#39;s illegal activities.<br /><br />Commit crimes = Go to jail<br /><br />Commit crimes trying to hurt Trump = TV appearances galore, Book deal, Huge stripper tour, top dollar for your next gang bang, etc...<br /><br />Something fishy here	UCW3uY8ZRfQz6zoDILgh5IjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW3uY8ZRfQz6zoDILgh5IjQ	0

Laws by nature restrict something or force something. In the case of gay marriage then great, gay people can be legally entitled to the benefits of marriage with a joint filing tax deduction, insurance benefits etc... Then before you know it some christian guy who owns a cake shop or a flower store is getting sued for discrimination because he doesn't want to bake a cake or provides flowers for a gay wedding. Both political parties have their negative aspects. If you view the republicans to be more distasteful than democrats then fine.

I completely agree that stuff like free speech is mandatory and people should not be offended by that but going so far as to say ANYTHING is an absolute, and absolutes are republican's favorite type of sentences, welcome to the Republican world. Your argument is stupid from the first place, the guy said that he mocks everyone that deserves to be mocked, including Democrats, its not his fault that Republicans are mostly the ones doing stupid shit. Also for a guy that thinks that people should have complete freedom to say anything they want, you seem awfully offended by John's videos and him mocking Republicans.

Liberal is democrat, conservative is republican. Neither party actually adheres to the values of liberalism/conservatism but that is how it shakes out. My viewpoints align most closely with Libertarianism. People should have complete freedom to do and say what they want as long as they are not physically hurting others or stealing from them. This puts me on the republican side in our political system.	UCROccd74MaSGJJ8DM6Ix_Bg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCROccd74MaSGJJ8DM6Ix_Bg	1	UgyDddJkyUbaQtm4vv14AaABAg	Danielle Spargo

That these views tend to align more with a liberal mindset than a conservative one is not the same as being Democratic rather than Republican. America as a country really needs to get over the idea that everything has to be an "us versus them" argument, because such extremism is counterproductive to the growth of our country and the unity of our people.

My first reply to the comment thread was that I think that this show shills (promotes) the Democrat party. The initial response given to me was that this show also makes fun of democrat politicians. I asked for an example and was told to look it up myself. I said that I have already seen many clips of the show and I think it is a Democrat shill. At this point I asked if people thought the show was neutral. The responses I got were all over the place, none of which would say yes or no. Finally someone said yes, there is a bias towards one of the two political parties because bias is inherent to anyone with a personal opinion. I was curious as to just how long it would take, and how many people it would take for someone to actually admit the show is biased in favor of democrat political views.

John has his own personal political beliefs, and it would be ludicrous to expect him not to hold to them in a show that bears his name. That said, if you've actually WATCHED the show you'd have seen examples of him dumping on dems as well as reps. Want one example? How about the episode where he was discussing the comparative scandals of Hilary versus Trump prior to the election, where he goes into detail about the issues both candidates had. Yes, Trump still came out on bottom, but not for lack of razzing on Hilary. It would be wonderful if there was a truly nonpartisan source of news. Unfortunately, no such thing exists, especially not if you're using as your reference an HBO-funded comedy late-night talk show hosted by someone who, as a non-American, can look at things from a more detached, cynical view than most of us who've been spoon-fed nationalism and patriotism since childhood are willing to take for our own country. John will probably have more opportunities to get his jollies picking on Reps for a long time, simply because -- at least in our current political climate -- they are by far the more vociferous and over-the-top of the US's political parties, at least the ones that tend to get media attention. The Dems as a whole are in a period of complacency that has put the entire country in a very nasty position, but also keeps them out of the media's attention on many issues, for better or worse. All the other parties we have are either so small as to be inconsequential or so busy squabbling over petty issues rather than focusing on actually making a difference as to reach the same result. Sure, he COULD pick on them... but where's the interest or intrigue? Don't want him to pick on Reps so much? Next time, get them to pick a presidential candidate with less bombastic tendencies and more sense. Want him to pick on Dems more? Get them to pick a candidate with a platform other than "I'm not a Republican" and make them all grow goddamn spines.

A woman can't be a misandrist and a feminist that is hypocrisy, because feminism advocates women's rights based on equality of the sexes; so if a woman is a man-hater she is a misandrist (a sexist) which means she is not for equality of the sexes and the core of feminism is equality of the sexes. So a radical feminist is not a feminist by definition, they are hypocritical assholes in need of critical thinking skills better than a goldfish's.

The news has always been something I use as teaching topics since I can refer 2 past events in history as well as our advances in science, sociology, & psychology, & (whether some agree or not physiology, b/c evolution is a thing). I use different networks & sources, you'll b surprised how my oldest calls out FOX news, (I only use them 4 comparison😒 nothing more) Anyways, I had a hell of trouble when CNN had a big headliner on the screen talking about a payout to a Porn Star😳 My oldest read it B4 I could b/c I was fixing lunch 👀she's like "I have never heard of a porn star🤔 is that how u say it?😰OMG I froze & ran 2 read up close (didn't have my glasses on 2 make things even better) 😱 I turned off the TV & made them eat, I just mumbled "I'll show u a video later" which was NOT the thing 2 say 😱 but when I'm unsure about something we always look up YouTube 4 reference. Anyways, I kept on checking on my phone 4 the news channels throughout the day & avoided it 4 as long as I could, a few days. When she heard the phrase (again on the news) few days later, I pretty much referenced a stripper. Yes I said Trump paid a dancer (b/c kids are so darn bright when they're young🙄, she remembered it had 2 do w/ Trump paying) so he paid her 2 not tell his wife he was partying at a bar where girls dance😩 strippers are seen in movies & videos a lot (it seems 2B the culture nowadays) 😜so my innocent children think girls dancing around a pole are kind of like models that get paid 4 been so beautiful & of course they don't take off their clothes, what is wrong w/ U ? 😂😂😂😂😂	UC0vEUillu0jYoPWlodi-GMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vEUillu0jYoPWlodi-GMw	1	UgzM3DjRILvwRMhpKQd4AaABAg	mercedes gomez

And yes, I work. Be it 4 hours a day because of my own psychological situation, but I'm still working. Not playing video games all day, not feeling sorry for myself but busting my ass every single day. So don't call me lazy or uneducated, I'm neither. Thank you very much. Do you know what "incapable" means, sir? I couldn't "get" empathy from somewhere even if I wanted to. You are right about one thing however.. I couldn't be happier with that. Empathy is a waste of brain capacity and time. You help those people if you like, I'm good. Nice pep talk, tho.. would have worked on a lesser man.

Too bad he was a mentally unstable junkie, whose brain gave up on him by age 44, so he had to rely on his sister's compassion for a whole decade to take care of him; didn't even commit suicide in support of his own 'no place for the weak' ideology. That's the problem with people who lack empathy: they are hypocrites and they tend to turn their own inadequacy and selfhate into something they think others should admire. So if you are ever sick or homeless or unemployed - remember your own comment, do not burden your family or the state, do "the right thing".

Family courts favoring women when it comes to decide who's gonna keep the house, the kids (+ child support) and getting alimony, as if the men are assumed to handle all of that without problems. Soldiers lifes sacrified in the Middle East for the sake of oil control and keep the conflicts alive in the region so the US Military has a justification to get their excessively massive defense budget to fight their "War on Terror" that has been going on for 17 years now.

And sómetimes I feel like the world would be better without an individual that bothers the rest. However...I never follow through with having the actual feelings of hate, it's just the thought. And...in this case, that individual would be you. The people you just mentioned, are living lives that you wouldn't last a day in. You're someone behind a screen, playing videogames, ás if that's helping the world. Perhaps those 'lazy people' are people with psychosis, like my neighbour, trying to keep their heads above water everyday. You want those to work at the cashdesk in the supermarket, knowing they'll commit suicide after a day of chaos? Your opinions are not so much repulsive, as they are ignorant, uneducated and incorrect and untrue. You're just dissapointed in society and you've figured that being numb to all human emotions is easier. Get some empathy from somewhere. And go the fuck outside and help one of those sick people. Because at this stage, they are helping society more than you are.	UCuvfMpFzFPdUnNn5WQ5vHRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvfMpFzFPdUnNn5WQ5vHRw	1	UgwR9cEah4u0VX7wrHJ4AaABAg	Tomáš Viktorin

Wouldn't go as far as 50%, but there's definitely a lot of people who just don't have a purpose or use on this planet. The sick, the homeless, the uneducated, people that are too lazy to work and rather sit on their asses collecting state funding etc. Now I'm incapable of all empathy, but I don't think my opinions are that repulsive.

Also males can impregnate and die off but his offspring lives on but only women can turn that cygote into a viable human being. Again. This is a pure cold science fact...however. Humans are unique in the fact we are capable of emotion and empathy. Use it to have some tact rudy. Your analogy fails at that...we get the point though. You want to bone her. I get it.

In order to cover a non-crime that was politically embarrassing, they wind up committing high crimes and misdemeanors as impeachable offenses. It was perjury in Clinton's case.

The more the Stormy Daniels crap is covered, the *better* his poll numbers get. "Stormy Daniels" is one of the top searches on Pornhub (I checked. Thoroughly. :p) - everyone fantasizes about banging a porn star at some point. Him doing it makes him more popular, not less. And the media is profiting off it. Michelle Wolf was absolutely right in calling them out on it. It's a welcome distraction from the actual problems the country faces that in ordsr to fix you'd need to rattle the (their!) apple cart.

Nothing &quot;happened&quot; to him over the past decade. He isn&#39;t &quot;off&quot; like many journalists and talk show hosts suggest. Giuliani has always been a controversial figure, and in many ways, he is just like Trump. What Giuliani is going to do to himself and to the Trump administration is far more pressing than his past.

It seems much less juicy than actual campaign money, as the connection has to be established by a certain interpretation of the payment, it really does not change anything. The "what if" is just too big in a world where things like openly considering firing Muller have become a political option. Also the fact that Trump lied once more, is entirely insignificant, because noone in the checks and balances section of the constitutional organs cares and neither do Trump's followers.

It doesn't have melody, or rhytm, but that's absolutely fine, Because the most important thing to me is that it rhymes. The subject of this video, though told with jokes and wit, Is not particulary happy, it's about a piece of shit. So if you will excuse me, I'll just write about something else, Like summerdays and water and ice-cream that never melts. Sitting in the pool with your feet in the water or try and learn to juggle, Dress up as Harry Potter and run around, screaming about Muggles. Try to PimpMyRide your Bicycle, which is something I still want to do, Craft something nice, paint something nice, something that works for you. Bake carrotcakes, write letters or go sing a song as loudly as you can, Get eggs, milk, cinnamon and bread and bake Frenchtoast in a pan. Learn Swedish or learn Swedish songs, that's easier to start out with, Get a fairytale-book, get inspired and write/make up your own city-myth. Run around like a lunatic, try irish-jigs or dance in your room like a ballerina, If you're a guy, or you're just very shy, shut the curtains so they cannot seeya. Speaking of S.I.A., hanging from the chandelier is also fun to do, Just make sure, the bolts are secured, or you'll be in the hospital soon. Get a unicycle, craft a handpuppet or learn to Yodel or whistle with your hand, Write with your opposite hand, try to knot special knots or dig your toes in sand. Walk barefoot through the dunes or the hills or the mountains, try something new, And if you're talented, walk on your hands, if you want an upsidedown view. Learn how to change your tires or to do accents around the world and imitate the Welsh, Grow a little garden, or just one plant or craft a gift for someone else(sh) And if everything fails, write a poem for a Stranger, under a John Oliver video, Either way, don't forget that there's so much to enjoy, good luck with it all. Cheerio!	UCuvfMpFzFPdUnNn5WQ5vHRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvfMpFzFPdUnNn5WQ5vHRw	1	UgwetzZ6yFcV4b1ZnAp4AaABAg	osmosis453

UgyqSVL2ac4SLhbgw6d4AaABAg.8fwLduGMFf-8fwW3bw_SBb		3	2018-05-07 08:02:35	Aaron Hoy	This is only the main topic of this week's show... they also do usually multiple other pieces that are quick takes on subjects. Why the hell would the eruption of the Hawaiian volcano (one that literally has been in a continuous eruption since January 3, 1983 https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=332010 [click on Eruptive History],) merit more than a brief sentence or two at most? There has not been any deaths, I mean it sucks for the people who lived near it & have had to evacuate their homes... I wish them the best of luck in getting their life back together after the disruption to it this has caused, but (& I don't mean to sound like such a d-ck here,) this really doesn't have any relevance on literally anyone other than those people & those people have insurance, the state declared an emergency meaning they can step in via various ways & provide aid & help to people so I mean what would the story be here? Also by the way, "It's just Trump every week" here is a list of the titles/topics of literally every episode posted on the YouTube channel for this season beginning with the last episode [2 weeks ago,] & working backwards to the beginning: Iran Deal Corporate Taxes Crisis Pregnancy Centers Immigration Courts Mike Pence Cryptocurrencies NRA TV Italian Election Trump vs. The World So, this whole "trump every week" is a fairly weak claim & even if it were true so what? He is in charge of the most powerful country in the world, one with multiple active military conflicts it is engaged in around the world, one that has virtually no checks nor balance to intervene whenever the President chooses to do whatever militarily in the world while he is an impulsive child used to no accountability due to whatever amount of money he does actually have, who has been surrounded his entire life by yes-men, who doesn't understand sh-t about government, & who does/says outrageous falsehoods literally every day. You can't go anywhere in the world since Trump has been in office without seeing news articles & segments about him almost every day in most media organizations that are moderately big in any country. Now personally, I wish that media outlets would focus more on issues & the sh-t that is being done in the country rather than his dumba-s actions & statements so much, but I have always wished to news actually covered important issues & the things that were being done instead of whatever stupid stuff they happened to be focused on at any particular time... but surely you have to understand why he gets so much coverage, at least if you have ever tuned into the news for any period of time over the past 20 or so years.

The other ones have been the Iran Deal, Crisis Pregnancy Centers, Bitcoin, the NRA, Corporate Tax avoidance, Immigration, and the Italian Election. Sure, Trump is involved in some of those things because they're major stories and he's the f'ing President of the US. If he'd stop doing that, then I doubt his name would come up very often.

If you're upset that John talks about Trump every week, just imagine how the rest of us feel when Trump talks about Trump every fucking goddamn day. Donald Trump is the human (citation needed) equivalent of a distended baboon rectum festering in the sun and he deserves all of the mockery he receives.
