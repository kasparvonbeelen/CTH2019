    "#### **What** is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language): Python is a widely used **high-level** programming language for **general-purpose** programming.\n",
    "- ** high-level programming language**: In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with **strong abstraction from the details of the computer**. In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use **natural language elements**, be easier to use, or may **automate** (or even **hide** entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of **abstraction** provided defines how \"high-level\" a programming language is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why** Python?\n",

    "In general, Python is **easier to learn and to read**. Let's look at a very simple example. "
