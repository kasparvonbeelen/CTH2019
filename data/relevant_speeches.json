I also say I have the best woman in the world as a wife. I hope that everybody else would say \u201cno, it's my wife\u201d. I really love my constituency and the people in it. They are very good. I also represent the province of Alberta which has been a net payer into the system except for one occasion approximately 30 years ago when it received a very small equalization payment in one year. In the broader sense I represent the people of Elk Island but also the people of Alberta who have a very great interest in how their money is spent. This money is taken from them through the coercion of taxation and they have every reason in the world to demand accountability on how that money is spent. I am here to represent not only my riding but the province of Alberta. I really am sorry that the member from the Progressive Conservative Party who answered my question totally misread it. I asked what I thought was a decent question that could have addressed the question of the mathematics and the formula used and whether equality is really equality. The member debased himself into an answer with political rhetoric. The NDP member joined in on it. Somehow they think by oft repeating this message Canadian people will believe it. That is just not true. People in my riding want to keep this country together. I suppose one of the reasons the support for me and our party out west is so strong is that we are the only party that has ever come up with a decent plan for keeping this country together, reaching out to Quebec in a tangible way, trying to meet its needs and aspirations which this Liberal government and the Conservatives before it rode over roughshod. We are reaching out to it. These people criticize us because we occasionally have dialogue with members from the Bloc. I think it is about time we dialogued with all people of Quebec. A fairly good number, 50%, have been sending separatists to the House of Commons and to the provincial legislature in Quebec. That sends a very strong message. There is trouble in Ottawa. It is time to address it honestly and try to find a solution to it. Instead, what we get is this attempt by the Liberals, and now the Conservatives who have joined in, to crawl over each other and put each other down. They do not want us to work together. They want power. I do not know whether this is going to be misunderstood, but I do not want power at all. I have no need for it. My ego does not require this kind of a cheap ego trip. I want to serve the people of Elk Island, the people of Alberta and the people of Canada. Unless we are going to write off Quebec like these other parties are doing, that includes an honest and open dialogue with the people of Quebec. My question to the member was very clear and explicit. Does he have a hope that Quebec, with its vigorous population, its strengthened natural resources and all of its other amenities and strengths, will ever become independent in the sense that it will be able to row its own canoe and be financially independent? I would hope so. That would be my desire for every province in this country, and it is certainly true for the province of Quebec as well. I reach out to them because I believe that we need to do what we are proposing in the new Canada act. We need to make sure that we listen to and obey the Constitution of the country which puts a lot more responsibility with the provinces and gives them the freedom to run their programs. That is what the original Constitution envisioned. Successive Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments have chewed away at that, primarily by the use of spending power. They tax all Canadian citizens individually. They tax individual businesses. They do not tax the provinces. They tax the taxpayers. They then turn around and with all of this money that they have in their pockets jingling away, they take it and put it into wherever they think it should go. We have no objection to the principle of equalization. In fact if I were to get this debate right on stream, I think it is appropriate for us to once again read the principle of equalization that was adopted in the Constitution Act, 1982. This is something I believe we could support wholeheartedly, provided it is done properly. Section 36(2) of the Constitution Act reads: Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. I doubt if there are very many Canadians across the country who would disagree with that as a principle. There may be some, but I am not one of them. I am one who believes in lending a hand of help to people who are truly in need. Later on I will address how we actually determine this equitability or equality. The principle of every citizen in this country having access to education and to be not denied the right to extend their education beyond high school because of financial restrictions is a principle that I would endorse most wholeheartedly along with 99.99% of Canadians. It is unconscionable that we have in this country a two tier education system, thanks to Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments, where the people who come from rich families can march right out of high school into post-secondary institutions. Because they are rich they have the money to pay the big tuition fees, the big cost for books and all of the other expenses that are involved. For many Canadians it involves living away from home while they are going to school. If they are rich they can afford it. But what happens if they are poor? Over the years governments have deteriorated the transfer of funds to the provinces, which they should not have been into in the first place, but they got into it by use of the spending power. When they did that originally it was for a good cause and it was done well. The principle was that no one in the country should be denied the right to post-secondary education because they could not afford it. The federal government taxed the money from all of the people and from all of the businesses. Then it paid the money back to the provinces so they could provide educational facilities at reasonable cost. In the mid-fifties and early sixties I was a university student, a recipient of that largesse. I am grateful to this day. It was a wonderful privilege. I was the first member of my family\u2014and I have mentioned before that I am a first generation Canadian\u2014to go on to university. What a privilege it was to be educated and then later on get into the business of education so that I could pass on the knowledge which I had gathered. I believe in that principle. What do we have now with this Liberal government? The government has a fancy scheme of putting students into interminable debt. When these students graduate from school they will have a debt as big as half a mortgage on a house. Shortly after I graduated my wife and I got married and started a household. In today's world, if a young couple were to do that, together their debt load for their education on average is equal to the debt of buying a house. How are they going to also finance a house? How are they going to finance the starting of their business, be it a law practice, a dentistry practice or whatever it is? They cannot because they have so much debt. They are in debt federally because their share of the federal debt is $20,000. They are in debt provincially because all of the provinces have been going into debt. They are in debt personally because they have encountered all of these wonderful student loans. I really believe that we ought to look at that again. I do not believe that we are investing properly in our young people. I believe that if equalization payments are to be made from the federal government to the provinces it should be done in such a way that it helps those who are in need. I think about health care. Every once in a while we hear of people, in fact too frequently, who because they are rich can afford to go to the United States to get superb health care. I know of a family who lives in my community. It is actually a very sad story. This young married man, who has a couple of children, was feeling tired. His mother was also not feeling well. But they could not get any proper diagnosis in our health care system. First, they wait six months to get in line. When they do get into the health care system there is inadequate equipment. Many of the really skilful medical practitioners have gone off to the United States where there is more money available for their research and for them to be able to practise their profession. These people, because they had the means, went to the Mayo Clinic. Unfortunately my friend was diagnosed with MS, which is a very serious disease. They could not even figure out what it was here in Canada. Fortunately he had enough money to go there. He also took his mother along. Unfortunately they diagnosed a terminal disease and she has now since passed away. We often hear the hue and cry \u201cWe don't want a two tier health care system\u201d. The fact of the matter is, we have it. This government started out with a good principle. The principle was to make equalization payments so that people in the different provinces could have an equal level of services without undue taxation. When the federal government originally brought this in it funded 50% of health care costs. It did that quite consistently for a few years. Then payments started to decrease. I do not know if my number is accurate, but a number which I heard recently put it as low as 13%. In other words, we are still being taxed. Nobody in the country feels that their tax rates have gone down, notwithstanding what the Minister of Finance says. If we look at our bottom line at the end of the year we realize that the average family has, as the statistics from Statistics Canada show, a take home income of $3,000 a year less. We are still being taxed to the hilt, but health care is no longer being funded adequately. What the government has done in the present budget is woefully inadequate in terms of restoring what it should be doing relative to the original purpose of equalization. There are two issues. One is to provide comparable levels of services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. What does the equalization plan do? I do not know whether people who are watching on CPAC or even members of the House are aware of this, but one of the strange things is that both the provincial and federal governments tax individuals and businesses and then the federal government pays some of the money back to the provincial governments directly. Originally that was to be done without strings attached, recognizing the legislative and the constitutional right of the provinces to manage these affairs. I found a really interesting quotation in the report of the auditor general. One of the recommendations in that report came from the Rowell-Sirois commission which was formed in 1937. That is interesting because it happens to be two years before I was born. It was a dominion provincial relations commission. One of its recommendations was that the dominion government should make annual national adjustment grants to the needy provinces. The report went on to describe that. Then the commission wrote that the grants would be unconditional and the provinces would be free to decide how to spend them or whether to use them to reduce provincial tax rates. In other words, the principle of equalization was embodied in the report of 1937. Have we lived up to that? No. Now we have a top-down, heavy-handed federal government saying to the provinces \u201cWe will give you the money\u201d. But are there strings attached? Big time. My province of Alberta, which as I said in my introduction I am here to represent as well as all of Canada, has been dinged several times. Even though this was its own jurisdiction according to our Constitution, the federal government, utilizing its arbitrary and heavy-handed ability to spend the money it taxes, simply withheld funding from the Alberta government's portion of health care. That is unfair. It is wrong. It is illegal, but no one stands up to the government. Then we have the separatists. Liberal members cannot figure out why they are here. They shake their heads. Instead of trying to ask the question \u201cWhy are they here?\u201d they continually accuse them. I will not do that. I will not accuse the separatist members for being here. Their people back home sent them here. As far as we know the elections were fair and square and the ballots were properly counted. There are enough people out there who say \u201cWe are so fed up with Ottawa that we want out of this thing\u201d. That is terrible. I know of several families whose children have left on very, very bad terms. It is painful. Those parents hurt when that happens. We as Canadians all hurt when somebody leaves or threatens to leave. We do not end up criticizing them, bawling them out and yelling at them. We sit down with them. We want to talk to them. We want to find out what are their true legitimate grievances and to solve them. What has happened with the Liberals? Over and over all they have done is added more grievances to their list. That has to come to an end. It has to be communicated to the people of Quebec so that they will send people here who want to work with the federal government. Notwithstanding some of the political rhetoric we get around here, and I say this as humbly as I possibly can, I believe that the Reform Party and the principles we espouse contain the seed of the grand reconciliation we need so desperately in the country. Then we can say to the people of Quebec and to all other provinces that we will respect the Constitution and make sure they have the right to manage their affairs properly. When I speak to the equalization bill I believe we need to get back to the principle which says that we tried to reach an agreement with the provinces so that their people could have the same level of services in education and particularly in health. When we think of welfare, public services like national highways and roads and so on, there are huge costs of running provincial governments. There is absolutely no problem on the part of the Reform to say that those who are truly in need should be able to have those needs met. In the last minute I would like to say something about the formula. Given that we are admitting we will do that, how do we determine what is equitable? That is the problem. The legislation requires that the act be renewed every five years. We have known since 1994 that this would expire in 1999. What did the government do? Two or three working days before it was introduced in the House we were given notice of it. Then the government almost immediately invoked closure. It had to push it through because it had to be done by the end of the month. I agree with that. I disagree with the amendment we are speaking to which says we will basically hoist it. I do not think we want to put the provincial governments into such a disaster as the Progressive Conservatives would propose with their amendment that would not give them these payments. We need to have a longer process. I propose that we ought to do that. The next process should start as soon as this one is renewed. Let us hear from some academics. We heard some very excellent witnesses in committee. Let us have some academics to answer these\u2014", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19990309-880.3.1.49", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Diane Ablonczy", "party": "Reform", "date": "1999-03-09", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, we are on the third and final reading of an act that affects the equalization arrangement we have. Essentially equalization takes money from the federal tax base collected from the wealthier provinces and pays it to the less wealthy provinces to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenue to provide comparable public services at comparable rates of taxation. This is one of the arrangements in our federation that brings equity and equality to citizens across the country. This is a very good goal and a goal that makes our country work well. Unfortunately over the years the whole equalization arrangement has become very convoluted, very inefficient and full of complexities that have not been addressed. This arrangement is actually unfair, inequitable and in great need of reform. This bill should be doing that. It does not. The bill renews the current five year equalization agreement which expires at the end of this month. Specifically, the bill makes some amendments to the formula that determines equalization payments but the amendments amount to nothing more than mere tinkering. I point out to Canadians watching this debate that this topic, although it seems dry and academic, is actually of tremendous importance to Canadians. It deals not only with the very heart of our federal system but with the billions of the tax dollars that we work hard for, we give to government and pay into programs like equalization. The practice of equalization started at the beginning of Confederation in 1867. At that time it involved a few hundred thousand dollars per province. Today equalization transfers alone approach $9 billion a year. This is in addition to other transfers from the federal government to the provinces like the Canada health and social transfer which supports health care and education, the EI funds, regional grants and other smaller programs. If we were looking at total transfers with an equalization component, the total payments would be much higher than $9 billion, perhaps three times as much or upwards of $25 billion to $30 billion. We are dealing with enormous amounts of our money. Because of that, this debate should be of great interest to all Canadians. Although this is a complicated program, and I am a novice on the subject, a few scholars have written about it, the most recent being Dr. Paul Boothe, a professor of economics at the University of Alberta. Six months ago Dr. Boothe wrote a 60 page analysis of the equalization system. Just a week ago he testified before the finance committee on the subject of equalization. For Canadians who want to understand this rather complex area, I suggest they look at Dr. Boothe's work on this subject, \u00abFinding a Balance: Renewing Canadian Fiscal Federalism\u00bb, released October 30, 1998. Professor Boothe provides four reasons for transfers between the federal government and the provinces. There is the federal rationale that says each level of government must have the revenues it requires to carry out its constitutional responsibilities. The central government has taxing powers to collect more taxes than it needs to spend while provinces collect less than they need to spend. That makes these kind of transfers between the federal and provincial governments necessary under our constitutional system. There is an implication in the Constitution that these transfers will be unconditional. That of course has changed over the years. There is also the citizenship rationale that says that citizens have a right to certain publicly funded social and economic services. Due to imbalance in the powers of taxation between the provinces and the federal government that I just mentioned transfers become necessary. The citizenship rationale about citizens having a right to publicly funded services suggests that transfers would have some specific objectives. There is a suggestion that transfers should be unconditional. There is a suggestion that transfers should have specific objectives and those need to be balanced out. There is also the economic efficiency rationale that transfers can be used to alleviate efficiency problems related to the mobility of workers, which means that they can be used to encourage workers to move where the jobs are. Transfers could be used to alleviate bad practices in one province that harm another province, for example grants to induce a province to clean up air pollution and not export it to other provinces. Those kinds of grants would be conditional. Then there is the equity rationale, closely related to the citizenship rationale, that says the federal government should give the same services and transfers and levy the same taxes on similarly situated individuals regardless of where they live and the provinces should do likewise. Because provinces do not have identical taxes, services or transfers, this implies an enormous increase in the role of the federal government and very large equalization costs. I mention this to try to gain some understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of this whole equalization program. Understanding what we are trying to achieve is important before we can examine a program and ask if it is delivering what we had hoped it would deliver. The history of the equalization program is also interesting and although it may seem like a dry academic exercise it is helpful for Canadians trying to understand this whole issue of equalization to go through it quickly. Prior to Confederation most provincial revenues came from customs and excise taxes. With the loss of customs duties, because the federal government became exclusively responsible for levying customs duties, the provinces faced a fiscal crunch in meeting their constitutional responsibility to provide key services to their citizens. Therefore the Fathers of Confederation established a system of transfers providing each province with a statutory grant of 80 cents per person to a maximum of 400,000 persons. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were also paid a special grant, acknowledging that they trailed Ontario and Quebec in economic development. Between Confederation and the Great Depression transfers from Ottawa fell as a proportion of provincial revenues. During the depression governments raised taxes to combat deficits. The tax system became very fragmented and complicated and some described it as a tax jungle. What happened in the 1930s may sound familiar to us in the 1990s. As Professor Boothe points out, at one point the city of Edmonton levied an income tax. Transfers from the federal government to the provinces soared, rising from 10% of federal revenue to 45%. Because the situation was spiralling out of control, a commission was set up, always a time honoured way to study a problem, called the Rowell-Sirois commission. It made a number of recommendations in 1939 concerning unemployment relief, the collection of taxes and provincial debt. An important recommendation of the Rowell-Sirois commission in 1939 was that the federal government institute a system of \u201cnational adjustment grants\u201d for poorer provinces and that general transfers be made to ensure that the provinces had enough revenue to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities without undue taxation. During the second world war the federal government rented the income tax field from the provinces in return for fixed transfer payments with the understanding that it would be returned after the war. After the war the federal government wished to continue with the rental of personal income taxes. Ontario and Quebec resisted. Ontario did join the tax rental agreement in 1952. Quebec remained outside and set up its own personal income tax system in 1954. That led to the development of the present equalization system. Formal equalization payments began in 1957 with a fiscal arrangements package that had both an equalization and a stabilization component. The equalization component was calculated based on the average revenue from three tax bases in the two richest provinces. This is important because the base for calculation keeps shifting from here on in. In 1962 the equalization formula was altered, based now on a national average rather than two provinces, and natural resource revenue was included in the tax base. Some of it was, not all. Thus Alberta became a contributing province. These agreements last for five years. We are discussing a five year renewal today. Five years after that in 1967 the equalization formula calculation was expanded to include the revenue from 16 bases. By this time the federal government had transferred 28 personal income tax and 10 corporate income tax points to the provinces and was offering more in lieu of federal contributions to other programs. We get transfers for other programs mixed in with equalization. The number of eligible tax bases continued to expand. In 1974 the government abandoned full equalization of energy revenues. In 1977 the government instituted established programs financing to convert cost shared grants for health care and post-secondary education into block or unconditional grant transfers of only half their former size. At the same time, an equivalent amount of personal income tax and corporate tax points was transferred to the provinces. The cash transfer, which was an equal amount per capita across Canada, was to grow with the economy Rising energy prices in the 1970s created problems for equalization and Ontario qualified as a receiving province for the first time. We saw the introduction of the national energy program through which the federal government confiscated Alberta's tax revenues to maintain low fuel prices in central Canada. Now we get resource taxation being mixed into equalization. In 1982 the equalization formula was again altered by moving to a five province standard, excluding Alberta and the four Atlantic provinces, the richest and the four poorest. Also in 1982 the federal government linked the established programs financing cash component with the tax points. This meant that the federal cash transfer would grow less rapidly than the economy, as had been earlier promised. In addition, the per capita transfer for the three contributing provinces was reduced. Most important, in 1982 the federal government and all provinces except Quebec agreed to enshrine the principle of equalization in the Constitution, section 36(2). In 1990 the federal government, as part of its deficit reduction battle, capped the growth of Canada assistance plan payments for B.C., Alberta and Ontario, the only three that were not receiving equalization payments. In 1995 the Liberals introduced the Canada health and social transfer which was really a slash and burn effort on health care and education. It reduced the total transfer for those programs from $18.5 billion to $11.5 billion and locked in the differential treatment of B.C., Ontario and Alberta. We know of the great hardship this reduction of the Canada health and social transfer put on provincial health, education and social services. The point I make with this history is this. The evolving complexity and patchwork of this program and the fact that it was impacted by a multitude of diverse political purposes to achieve different results from time to time has made this program exceedingly complex. In addition to equalization there are intergovernmental transfers which add in a component of equalization. In other words, we have equalization and then we have equalization of other transfers. We have equalization on top of equalization which has resulted in some very unfair distortions in the transfers from the federal government to the various provinces. This bill is about the fiscal arrangements act, equalization payments, but I submit this debate should include a discussion on other major intergovernmental transfers besides equalization, in particular the Canada health and social transfer and regional differences in employment insurance because they also have an equalization component. As was said earlier, equalization was designed to ameliorate imbalances between revenue and spending responsibilities across the provinces. Today the provinces have access to per capita revenues equal to the potential average of five provinces, B.C., Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. This five province standard includes 33 different tax bases. I hope members are struggling with this as much as I am because what happens is that in a democracy when billions of our dollars are being spent we need to understand how they are being spent and why they are being spent. I think the history on what I am going through now shows how this program lacks transparency, lacks accountability and therefore lacks the kind of scrutiny we as the public in a democracy need to give it. The calculation of the values for each tax system is very complicated. Imagine the complication when 33 different systems in each of the 10 provinces are involved. The system also has rules governing floors and ceilings, growth rates and so forth. It has been said that only a few academics and bureaucrats in Canada fully understand the system. I submit it has yet to be proven that anyone understands it. Yet we have only a few hours of debate in the House to even try to talk about it, never mind address it in a meaningful, focused way. Federal equalization payments will total about $9 billion this year. Federal equalization transfers in 1996-97 ranged from a high of about $1,800 per person for Newfoundland to a low of about $220 per person in Saskatchewan. As I pointed out earlier, B.C., Alberta and Ontario receive no equalization payments. In addition to that variance, the CHST per capita amounts vary across the provinces. Alberta received the least in 1996-97 of $416 per capita while Newfoundland and Quebec received the most in over $600 per capita. The same regional differences are present in the EI program. Currently then there are some real problems with these transfers. They result in individual inequity where a program was supposed to give equity to individual Canadians. They result for a number of reasons in inefficiency, and my colleagues have pointed out some of those inefficiencies. There is declining political viability where three provinces are consistently paying to seven supposedly poor provinces in a wealthy country like Canada and then we have to deal now with the impact of international competition. I urge the House, instead of just rubber stamping a renewal with a few tinkering changes to the equalization agreement, to do a substantial and sustained examination of the system, some fundamental reform, and move to something that is much fairer for Canadians and much more workable.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20010531-1893.2.1.9", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Stockwell Day", "party": "Canadian Alliance", "date": "2001-05-31", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, at the start of my comments I advise that I will be splitting my time today with the member for Lanark\u2014Carleton. Relating to the response and the question we have just heard, the British Columbia government passed a requirement that for healthy, employable people moving into the province, and it was very clear on that, there would be a three month residency requirement before they could access social services. That was the B.C. government supported by its population. Because it ran counter to federal Liberal philosophy that the program should be available even to healthy, able-bodied people, the government put pressure on the B.C. government and said that it would fine that government every day the policy was in place. That was in direct contradiction to the democratic request of the people of British Columbia. If we asked most Canadians whether there should be some kind of stipulation for healthy, employable people not to be able to immediately access social welfare programs, I think most would agree that there should be some kind of regulation and would not be in agreement with the federal Liberals. It gives me great pleasure to rise today to concur with the Bloc Quebecois on the motion. I am being very careful in saying that. It is not often I am able to do so. On many issues such as the great question of national unity we do not agree with the Bloc, but wherever possible, as is the Canadian way, we strive to find common ground and proceed from there. Today we are telling the government there is a common ground. We are asking the government to meet with the provinces to discuss the transfer of tax points. The transfer of tax points was actually our policy before the formation of the Canadian Alliance. During the last election campaign the Canadian Alliance once again made the proposal to transfer more tax points to the provinces. It is therefore appropriate that we call upon the government to meet with the provinces to discuss, at the very least, the next step in a process which was begun by the Liberals in 1977. With the usual glacier-like speed of government we are trying to get the issue addressed. All stakeholders should meet to discuss such a change because it affects all provinces. Therefore it should not be done unilaterally as the federal Liberals like to do on too many occasions. It is important to hear from all provinces so the merits and demerits can be properly considered. Governments across Canada want to provide comparable services to all their citizens, regardless of where they live. We want these principles to be upheld; they are part of the Canadian tradition. Allow me to put the issue in context by making an historical reference. The Rowell-Sirois commission, which was struck in 1937, made a proposal that only the dominion should levy income taxes. Although the proposal was initially rejected, when the war broke out it was adopted by the provinces strictly as a wartime measure. The provinces abandoned their income taxes and in return were supposed to receive unconditional payments to compensate them for that lost revenue. In its agreements with each province the federal government undertook that at the end of the war it would reduce federal taxes so as again to create room for the provinces to resume levying their income taxes. In 1977 the Liberal government of the day ceded back to the provinces some of the tax room that the federal government had taken away. However the arrangement has been frozen since 1977. The compromises provincial governments had to make 50 years ago to support the war effort must be recognized. The current Liberal government must act accordingly. We are not asking it to be generous, not at all, rather we are asking it to give back to the provinces the powers that are rightfully theirs. A further transfer of tax points would also address two fundamental problems. The first is the present mismatch between the responsibilities of the provinces and the power they have to tax. Last year three noted economists wrote a paper arguing that there \u201cis a fundamental mismatch between the taxing power of the federal government and its restricted spending jurisdiction\u201d. That is, the federal government simply takes in too much money compared to its constitutional responsibilities. It is an imbalance. That generates the political problem of democratic accountability, since the government that raises the taxes, in this case the federal government, does not actually spend the money. Instead, the federal government transfers cash back to the provinces in the form of the Canada health and social transfer. This means the federal government can cut the transfer arbitrarily, as the federal Liberals have done throughout their time in office. It has been their consistent approach. This has forced provinces to make drastic cuts in their areas of social spending, notably health care, and also undergo the consequent displeasure of the electorate. If the government does not transfer the full amount of resource, then provinces have to cutback and experience voter displeasure. The CHST is still lower today than when the Liberals came to power eight years ago. They have removed a cumulative $25 billion from the CHST, but since they do not deliver the programs funded by the CHST the provinces then wrongly take the political blame for those cutbacks. A further tax point transfer would help to realign democratic accountability, and that is what we are talking about. No longer would the federal government be able to reduce funding unilaterally and then place the blame for cutbacks on the provinces, as the federal Liberals have done consistently in the past. The second problem is a related one. It simply has to do with trust. For the last seven years the federal government has rejected its responsibility for health, social and post-secondary education spending. As a matter of fact, it has spent over $100 billion on grants and contributions, while sacrificing the most important social programs which Canadians want. Canadians are asking us how the federal government can then be trusted in the future to preserve that which is most valuable to Canadians? There is a lack of trust because of the history of the federal Liberals in this area. I believe that if the federal government feels it is necessary it will again act in a cynical, political way to abandon health care, if it is health care where the pressure is, or off-load cuts to education and social assistance to the provinces in order to preserve other items for their own public image. That has been their past history. I believe we run the risk of seeing that to be their future performance. The present system of fiscal transfers encourages federal irresponsibility. The logical step to restore confidence and trust in the security of funding for our social programs is to realign the taxing power with the spending power, as indicated in our constitution, to make sure the government, which has the constitutional responsibility to deliver program, also has the power to go to its electorate to raise the money to pay for the program. Can we trust the provinces? That is the next fair question. I believe we can. We can trust the provinces because those governments are all returned to office, or replaced and new ones brought in, by the very electors who share a broad democratic consensus for the need to have strong support for the social programs, especially health care. I remind the House that while the federal government was cutting over $6 billion per year from cash transfers for health, the provinces were increasing health care spending. They have proven their level of trust. They have earned the trust of Canadians and the government has not. The issue of tax point transfers enjoys broad support among not only the provinces, but also the opposition parties in the House of Commons. This area is one of great concern, as we have indicated. In 1997 Jean Charest's platform promised to convert $12.5 billion in CHST cash transfers to tax points in exchange for reaching a covenant defining federal and provincial roles in supporting health, post-secondary education and social programs. This is an excellent position, which we fully support and about which we continue to be in agreement with Mr. Charest. Accordingly we were very surprised and disappointed last week when we read what the current Conservative leader had told Le Soleil . I want to quote from the article: Bernard Landry faces an uphill battle in bringing Ottawa to agree to the transfer of tax points to the provinces. Even the Conservative leader is refusing to get involved in this fight. For the time being, in any case, it is not one of his priorities. Therefore he will not champion it in the House of Commons or anywhere else in Canada. That is why we support the Bloc motion.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19950619-1233.17.1.9", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "government", "speaker": "Jean Augustine", "party": "Liberal", "date": "1995-06-19", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on the agreement on internal trade which will come into effect on July 1. The agreement may not be perfect, in response to the Reform Party's comments, but it represents an improvement from where we were before that agreement. Bill C-88 is intended to make it possible for the federal government to comply fully with its obligations under the agreement. It is important the House proceed expeditiously in its consideration of Bill C-88. For years businesses and private sector groups have complained to both the federal and provincial governments about domestic trade barriers and impediments to a free and open internal market. We have had numerous studies going back as far as the 1937 Rowell-Sirois commission which recognized the issue and documented the broad scope of the problem. The Canadian Manufacturers' Association in 1991 estimated the cost associated with barriers and economic inefficiencies to be approximately $6.5 billion annually. The most recent statistics indicate interprovincial exports of goods and services in 1990 were worth $141 billion annually and responsible, directly or indirectly, for 1.7 million jobs. A recent study by the chamber of commerce underlined that the Canadian internal market is the most interdependent of any area in the world today. In agreeing to negotiate the agreement, Canadian governments recognize how well our domestic economy works. It is key to how we will prosper as a nation and how we will compete in the international economy. An open domestic market and economy will allow Canadians and Canadian companies to strengthen their internal competitiveness and develop new opportunities for growth and prosperity. The alternative offers only and ultimately self-destructive protectionism which benefits only special interests at the cost of the country as a whole. When they agreed to negotiate the agreement on internal trade the federal, provincial and territorial governments all recognised and accepted the importance of working together in the national interest. In concluding the agreement Canadian governments have demonstrated they are prepared to work together both now and in the future. As my colleague, the Minister of Industry, has said in the House, the agreement is a consensual agreement. Some members opposite have criticized the agreement as inadequate and insufficient. As I said before, the agreement may not be perfect but it is an improvement over where we were. It reflects a consensus on the principle of an open and efficient national economy. It establishes a detailed rules framework for internal trade. It provides a consistent and defined process for preventing and resolving disputes which may arise over specific issues or measures. All the parties have accepted, to a greater or lesser degree, disciplines which in the sectors covered will improve how the national economy functions in the future. It will be possible and it is the government's intention to work to improve the agreement in the future and to expand its scope and coverage.

For the moment this is a start, a point from which to work. We can and should build on that. Some members have also criticized the government for not exercising its constitutional authority over interprovincial trade to open the internal market more forcibly. The national economy has become considerably more complex than it was when the constitutional powers of the different levels of government were agreed on in 1867. In the context of today's economy and modern Canadian federalism the views of those critics, frankly speaking, are simplistic. If anything is clear it is that the country operates most successfully when all levels of government work co-operatively in the national interest, not unilaterally and certainly not by fiat. Governments were not negotiating constitutional changes in the agreement on internal trade; rather, they were developing the basis for working together with their respective powers and responsibilities to make the national economy operate more efficiently and effectively. Unilateral action may be a theoretically possible method to achieve the same ends. Some of us may consider it to be a desirable way of proceeding. However it is simply not an effective or acceptable way to make Canada's federal system work. Some members opposite have suggested the government has a hidden agenda in Bill C-88, that it conceals a power grab and that it is intended to provide a means to force provinces over to the will of the federal government. That is purely and simply wrong. My colleague, the Minister of Industry, has responded at length and in detail to those allegations. Bill C-88 does not deal with the responsibilities of provinces or provincial measures, only federal responsibilities and measures. It is intended to make it possible for the federal government to comply fully with its own obligations under the agreement and to play its part in making the agreement work. Bill C-88 gives the government specific authority to make changes to certain parts of legislation to enable it to act in accordance with its obligations. It also changes some existing legislation to make it easier for provinces to comply with some of their specific obligations under the agreements. We should be clear in our understanding that Bill C-88 does not by itself legislate or give life to the agreement on internal trade. The agreement has been signed by all its parties: the federal, provincial and territorial governments. When it comes into effect, as agreed on July 1, all those governments will be bound by the obligations of the agreement. Each government is responsible for complying with its obligations and for living up to its responsibilities under the agreement. Two provinces, Alberta and Newfoundland, have already passed their implemented legislation. As I said earlier, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our consideration of this legislation. The federal government has played a leading role in getting all governments to work together in the interests of all Canadians on internal trade issues. Bill C-88 does what is necessary to ensure the federal level of government will be able to continue to play its role in the co-operative intergovernmental process. We should not delay this further.

We should be clear in our understanding that Bill C-88 does not by itself legislate or give life to the agreement on internal trade. The agreement has already been signed by the parties-the federal, provincial, and territorial governments. When it came into effect July 1 all those governments became bound by the obligations they accepted when they signed the agreement. Each government is responsible itself for complying with its obligations and for living up to its responsibilities under the agreement.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I have this opportunity to present the motion in the House today. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the \"On to Ottawa\" trek. This motion calls for an apology, which is 60 years overdue. In Regina we have an historic marker set in front of the Regina city police station. On it appears the following: At 8.17 p.m. July 1, 1935, rioting erupted here in Market Square when RCMP and city police arrested the \"On to Ottawa\" trek leaders as they addressed trekkers and city residents. Rioting then spread to the 11th Avenue and Scarth Street area. Ending near midnight, it left extensive property damage, numerous injuries, and a city policeman, Detective C. Millar, dead. The trekkers were single men en route to Ottawa from B.C. to demand better conditions in relief work camps set up for the unemployed. They were stopped in Regina on June 14 by the federal authorities, who feared a revolution if the trek reached Ottawa. At a meeting between trek leaders and the federal cabinet, mistrust grew, and trekkers were prohibited from advancing or going home. To break the deadlock, Ottawa ordered the leaders' arrest. In the furor of the resulting riot, the frustration of the trek's failure and years of unemployment were released. The next day the provincial government arranged for the trekkers to return to their homes. Signed by the Government of Saskatchewan in 1979, the text on this marker refers to the tragic events known as the Regina riot. The text is short and temperate and barely explains why the provincial government signed an epitaph commemorating a riot. I will attempt to do that. Facts will show that the riot was planned and provoked not by the trekkers but by the police on direct orders of the federal government, which in so doing illegally usurped the authority of the provincial government, which was in the process of negotiating a settlement with the trekkers. The riot was the climax of a strike of the relief camp workers begun on April 4, 1935, in British Columbia. With a set of demands adopted at a meeting of the relief camp workers' union in Kamloops on March 10, 1935, the strikers stayed for two months in Vancouver and then started east to Ottawa to put their grievances before the government of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. Before arriving in Regina, the trek's ranks were augmented with new recruits. By the time the trekkers reached Regina the numbers had swelled to 2,000. Unbeknownst to the trekkers and the Saskatchewan government, Regina was their ultimate destination, not Ottawa. Having stopped them in Regina, Prime Minister Bennett arranged to meet with a few representatives. He obviously did not want the entire trek to arrive in Ottawa, with however many more who would have joined along the way. Unfortunately the meeting with the Prime Minister was unproductive. Bennett offered a temporary camp near Lumsden, Saskatchewan, where the trekkers would go until arrangements were made to return them to the permanent camps and the same inhumane conditions they had left. All along the only option the federal government was prepared to give the trekkers was no option. The status quo is the operative word. When the trekkers' representatives returned to Regina from Ottawa, they attempted to undo the deadlock the Prime Minister's offer had presented by developing a revised proposal. They worked diligently to set up meetings with all the authorities. The trek leaders also decided to hold a public meeting to inform the citizens of the result of their meeting with the Prime Minister. Posters went up, and it was known that only a few trekkers would attend the rally. Early in the morning on July 1, the trek leaders initiated negotiations with both the federal and the provincial governments in the hope of obtaining an agreement for an early withdrawal. One of the trek leaders, Arthur Evans, requested a meeting of federal, provincial, and trek representatives. The chief federal representative in Regina refused to meet with provincial officials but agreed to meet with the trek representatives at 10.30 a.m. At this stage federal officials in Ottawa refused an excellent opportunity to reach a peaceful compromise. They refused any compromise whatsoever. But the trek leaders did not give up. They went to Liberal Saskatchewan Premier Jimmy Gardiner, who promised them a reply the following morning. The premier had arranged for a cabinet meeting that evening. The fact is, when the trekkers were conferring with Gardiner the federal government was preparing warrants and strategy for the arrests of Evans and six other leaders of the trek. At the public rally that evening a crowd of 2,200 had gathered to hear a report of the trekkers' delegation to Ottawa. In this crowd there were no more than 300 trekkers, as most had already been informed and were slated to attend a ball game elsewhere. In other words, it was a known fact that the meeting was for citizens rather than trekkers. Why the choice was made to arrest the leaders in front of a mass meeting of their supporters raises serious questions. Why they did not wait until after the meeting, after the crowd had left, to make the arrests has never been fully explained. However, it does not take a rocket scientist to understand that it was the nature of the arrangements and the means by which the police carried them out that provoked the Regina riot. A more discreet and less provocative arrangement could have been devised and the arrests could still have been carried out successfully. The riot that resulted from this action left plainclothes detective Charles Millar of Regina city police dead, scores of trekkers, citizens and policemen injured, and several trekkers and Regina citizens hospitalized with gunshot wounds. Downtown Regina was left in a shambles. The riot began as the Premier of Saskatchewan and the provincial authorities were considering the trekkers' proposals. The provincial government had not been informed of police intentions. Premier Gardiner wired the Prime Minister late that night, both protesting the police action and offering to disband the trek under provincial auspices. It is not difficult to understand how this marked the beginning of a dispute between the federal and provincial authorities. Gardiner was fearful that the intransigent federal attitude would lead to a resumption of hostilities and he demanded the federal authorities take a more reasonable position. The federal government had taken over provincial jurisdictions, starting with control of the RCMP, which had moved to organize the Regina city and railway police forces. Preparing for a showdown, the federal government also moved into other provincial areas, namely transportation, blocking the trekkers from access to roads and allowing them to leave only if they agreed to go to the camp near Lumsden. The federal authorities had obviously taken it upon themselves to instruct the RCMP in Saskatchewan in the enforcement of the ordinary criminal law and not merely in matters under the Railway Act. This represented another violation of provincial jurisdiction. Based on the exchange between the Bennett and the Gardiner governments, it is more than fair to say that the Premier of Saskatchewan placed the responsibility for the tragic end to the trek in Regina squarely on the shoulders of the federal government of the day. The premier was not by any means alone in believing that. Ten years ago, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the \"On to Ottawa\" trek, I presented a similar motion in the House. At that time I had the benevolent support of one of our colleagues who now sits on the other side of the House. She said: \"We should say that we are sorry. While it may not mean much in terms of individual compensation for the agony suffered by those people who lived through the Depression, it would certainly be a first step on the road to clearing the record\". This is quoted from the Commons debate of October 7, 1985, when the present Deputy Prime Minister supported an official apology to the trekkers and the citizens of Regina. She also stated: \"And we, both as members and as the government, should apologize to the unemployed workers who were forced to take to the streets to seek their own rights, which they should have been given by the Prime Minister at the time, who abdicated his responsibilities in this respect\". Like our colleague in 1985, I now challenge the government to listen and redress this pivotal event in our Canadian heritage. I want to believe this government is different from the previous one. History need not repeat itself once again. Ten years ago the Deputy Prime Minister and member for Hamilton East accused the Mulroney government of taking the same attitude as the Bennett government of taking a hands off approach to solving the unemployment crisis. She said: \"It does not want to be involved in the creation of jobs because somehow Conservative governments see something distasteful in direct government job creation. In fact, the Bennett solution at that time was to send the workers off to work camps, where they lived in intolerable circumstances and in fact were not ever able to have the dignity of a democratic election in those particular camps\". The tables have turned. The hon. member now sits in power, where she can actually do something to ensure there is not only democracy but also employment, social justice, and a future for our young people. This government started its term with job creation and the infrastructure program, but something terribly wrong has happened. This government has been hijacked by some group with another agenda. The motion I have placed before the House might merely be regarded as a footnote in history were it not for the fact that history has a tendency to repeat itself. Since this year's budget, instead of jobs we got cutbacks and massive decreases in provincial transfers. Jobs, we are told, are not for the governments to create; they will appear out of market forces-as if Prime Minister Bennett has been resurrected one more time. By leaving the provinces in the lurch, some of the provincial leaders are quickly turning the country's clock back to the 1930s. The present government still has an opportunity to make good on its election promises and the hope they offered. The federal government does not need to starve the provinces by abandoning its responsibility to the people. The deficit reduction plan does not need to be inhuman. I agree with the endorsement from the member for Hamilton East of my 1985 motion, when in reference to the apology she suggested that \"that act of good faith and goodwill on the part of the government would begin to restore the credibility this government has lost in insisting upon measures that are anti-worker, anti-family, anti-labour, and anti-union. Work must be done or the government's word cannot be believed. Now is the chance for the government to win back some of the credibility it has frittered away since\"-to which I add, the end of October 1993. Let this government show us that it is not just another job eliminator party. The Liberal government has its chance to stand up and finally set the record straight by making to these people, the strikers, a general, all-encompassing public apology. The Deputy Prime Minister further stated 10 years ago: \"If it\"-meaning the Mulroney government-\"is truly sincere about beginning to gain back the confidence of young working people, young unemployed people, older working people, and older unemployed people to realize that the time has come for it to endorse an all-party resolution which calls for an apology to redress an event which occurred 50 years ago and which is indicative of the type of Conservative mentality which has led all Canadians to realize that Tory times are tough times\". The sad fact of the matter is that history, as I have just outlined, is in many ways and places across the country repeating itself. Many of the problems for which the trekkers sought solutions in the 1930s have returned in spades in the 1980s and continue in the 1990s. Once again we have massive unemployment. Once again we are faced with widespread business failures, farm foreclosures, personal bankruptcies, food banks, user fees, head taxes, and policies that are reminiscent of an era we had hoped to have surpassed. The political repercussions and the legacy of the trek have a lot of parallels with today's environment. The National Council of Welfare's 1995 report on the last government budget states: \"The policies of the 1990s will take us back to the 1950s\". Recent statements and actions from at least two provincial governments would confirm that. In a 1987 article in the Canadian Review of Social Policy by Duncan Rogers, a former deputy minister of the Alberta Social Services described the 1950s period as \"the remnants of the old relief days of the 1930s\". He goes on: \"It was not uncommon for children, particularly from larger families, to be apprehended as neglected and become wards of the crown simply because there was insufficient money available to the family\". The Liberal government is often accused of continuing the Tory legacy, while at the same time promising initiatives which will create jobs and opportunities for all Canadians. With nearly 10 per cent of our population unemployed, unemployment has become a chronic condition. Youth under employed is still worse, at 18 per cent. The rate for Canadians aged 15 to 24 years is nearly double the national average and costs the economy at least $4.5 billion per year. However, that is not the dearest price we are paying. Canada now has the third highest rate of teen suicide in the world, which has increased fourfold since 1960. The social and economic conditions under which kids are living are creating a social phenomena described as existential despair. Is that the best country the world? Will more jails and longer sentences deter the problems? They will do nothing if there is no hope for a future that brings rewards and fulfilment. I acknowledge the tremendous financial debt this country and the public sector faces due to the gross mismanagement of previous governments. I acknowledge the challenge that lies ahead for all of us to begin to solve our financial problems. Surely we must find ways of dealing with our problems other than on the backs of the old and the poor. As a Stats Canada study has shown, it is not increases in government expenditure that has created the debt. In fact, only 6 per cent of the debt is due to increases in public expenditure. The rest is due to loss of revenue and increases in interest rate payments. Of that 6 per cent increase in government expenditures, only 2 per cent is due to increases in social programs. It is not the social programs which have created our debt. Yet it is our social programs that are paying for it. It is the cutbacks in health services, in unemployment insurance, programs to help train and create jobs for young people. That is where the burden is being placed to rectify the terrible, physical mistakes that past Conservative and Liberal governments have made. We are in a period of declining standards of living. Recently, Stats Canada issued a report that in 1993 the average family income in Canada declined by some 3 per cent, inflation factored in. The decline for single parent families in that one year was 8.3 per cent. We are in a downward spiral. New challenging solutions are needed. But the solutions of R.B. Bennett did not work then and will not work now. I challenge the government to come forward with new imaginative proposals to give hope to our young people, to give employment to our young people and to give young people a future. I urge the House to adopt the motion to extend an apology for how those strikers were treated in 1935 in Regina some 60 years ago. They wanted to come to Ottawa to express their hope for a new future, to express their desire to work. They did not want welfare. They did not want the dole, they wanted jobs. Today the mass of unemployed young people are looking for work. They do not want handouts, they want a future. I urge the House to adopt the motion as a symbolic gesture to our young people that we are concerned about their future.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19951102-1266.10.1.2", "topic": "Private Members' Business", "role": "government", "speaker": "John English", "party": "Liberal", "date": "1995-11-02", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion of the hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle concerning the 1935 \"On to Ottawa\" trek and the Regina riot. The hon. member's motion recalls a time and place far removed from the Canada of today. It was the time of the Great Depression, a time of staggering unemployment, prolonged and terrible drought and the near collapse of national economies. There were shrinking markets and falling prices, all of which contributed to human misery and hardship on a scale seldom seen before in North America. This was a time when a woman working in a textile factory in Quebec could work a 60-hour week and earn only $5. The millions of acres of prairie wheat fields were turned into dust bowls and farmers walked away from family farms they had worked all their lives. In 1929 when the depression began there were 107,000 unemployed in Canada. By 1933, the worst year of the depression, there were 646,000 unemployed, approximately one-quarter of the Canadian work force at that time. The response of the Bennett government to the depression for younger men was to organize work camps. These work camps were organized under the Department of National Defence. The workers within them were paid 20 cents a day. This was an early and very harsh form of workfare. Conditions in the camps were well described by the member for Qu'Appelle. They were camps in which work was done for the sake of doing work. \"We are playing at highway building\", reported the striker in his diary. \"What a joke we are. We make a ditch one day and then change the plans and find that it is in the wrong place\". A public servant for the Conservative government: \"Not one cent of public money has been spent on reading material and recreational equipment\". The member has performed a service in drawing to our attention the consequences of this kind of attitude toward the unemployed and the consequences of using work camps, workfare or whatever to deal with the unemployed. One of the workers wrote at the time: \"It is really the fact that we are getting nowhere in the plan of life that moves us forward to march to Ottawa. We are truly a lost legion of youth rotting away for want of being offered a sane outlet for our energies\". The work camps were organized in B.C., it must be said, largely by communist workers. The workers organized for the trek to Ottawa and by the time they got to Regina in June of 1935 there were 12,000 workers. The Liberal premier of the province, Premier Gardiner, protested that the government of the day had decided to stop the workers there. Prime Minister Bennett met with the workers. The reply he gave them was very harsh and indeed he would not even let them talk. On July 1 unfolded the tragedy that has been described by the member opposite. One policeman died and we mourn his memory. Dozens of policemen and others, workers obviously, were injured. It is a black mark in the history of the depression. It is a black mark in the history of the city of Regina as well. The hon. member's motion suggests that the Conservative government of the day bears much of the responsibility for what took place in Regina and the judgment of history. The judgment of history in this case does largely bear out the hon. member's claim. I might add that during the depression solutions were not easy. Many kinds of solutions were made in various countries. The new deal in the United States was a very successful response to the depression but one that was thought to be authoritarian by many others. There were responses. In Italy Mussolini responded by making the trains run on time but also causing wars in places as far away as Abyssinia and responses in Germany where public works projects did create jobs. The party that the hon. member represents, the CCF, was formed during the 1930s and it sought solutions too. I quote from the Regina manifesto which called for complete social ownership and public management of the Canadian economy. It stated: \"All financial machinery, transportation, communications, electric power and all other industry and services essential to social planning should be nationalized and operated by the state; furthermore there be no compensation for bankrupt private concerns for the benefit of promoters and for stock and bond holders\". That is not the stand of his party today obviously. I mention this only because we have to give credit to people's views and their times and not to support R.B. Bennett's decision on that day in this particular case. However we can recognize that for us to judge today what they thought then reflects the judgment of a later day. We cannot, except in exceptional circumstances, apologize for history. The only people who can apologize for what took place in Regina, July 1, 1935 are the people who made the fateful decisions that precipitated the riot and they are dead. To apologize for the actions of a government in 1935 would be a well meant but futile gesture. If we cannot change history we can learn from it and we can look at the past wrongs through actions today. If you look at the demands of the strikers in 1935, you can see that the men who marched on Ottawa have in many ways had their wishes come true. The Canadian people tossed the Bennett government out of office in Ottawa in October 1935 and the Liberal government, which took office under Mackenzie King, righted many of the wrongs against which the strikers protested. For example, section 98 of the Criminal Code, which had been used for arbitrary arrest of strikers and others, was abolished. By 1940 we had unemployment insurance in this country. After 1940, we built a social system that offered a kind of minimum that the strikers and the people in the depression did not have. The best monument to the memory to the strikers of 1935 is the Canada we live in today. It is in our health care system which was created about 25 years afterward. It is in our system of unemployment insurance. It is in our comprehensive social services and it is in our fair hiring practices which was central to the protest made by the workers in Regina in 1935. Look around and ask, could the \"On to Ottawa\" trek and the Regina riot happen in Canada today? I think the answer is an unequivocal no. The hon. member has done a service to the people by placing the motion before the House, but while I cannot agree with this call for an official apology, I can applaud the sentiment that inspired this motion expressing profound regret that this government, indeed, all Canadians feel for what happened to Canadians during the Great Depression. It would be more fitting to honour the memory by taking the opportunity presented by this motion to re-dedicate ourselves to the principles of social justice that were lacking in Canada in 1935. Let us then work together to build a country where there is social equality and equal opportunity for all. It seems wrong to look at our own times and compare them to the 1930s and suggest that the conditions today, in any way, resemble those of the 1930s. The pay for the young men in the work camps was 20 cents a day. There was no unemployment insurance. There was no health insurance. There was no social system. There were no easy answers as well. Today, for whatever problems our economy faces, we have an unemployment rate that is probably one-third of what it was in the depression. We have protection for people who have lost their jobs. We have a government that is committed to creating jobs and work for Canadians and to maintaining a social system that protects the interests of all Canadians. I hope members will agree, including the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle, that what we have accomplished since 1935 is itself the best memorial to the strikers in Regina in July 1935.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19951102-1266.10.1.5", "topic": "Private Members' Business", "role": "government", "speaker": "Bob Nault", "party": "Liberal", "date": "1995-11-02", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, one interesting thing about being a parliamentary secretary is that you get to stay up late. So here we are. I thank the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle for keeping me up this late and bringing the motion before the House. The motion before us calls on the federal government, on the 60th anniversary of the \"On to Ottawa\" trek, to apologize for its actions at the time. According to the motion, the government's reaction to the march displayed a total lack of concern for the unemployed and the government was responsible for violence, loss of life, injuries, and the questionable jailing of several participants. In proposing the motion the member has given us a chance to consider the progress we have made in the last 60 years. I would like to reflect on where we were then and where we are now as relates to the labour movement. That is basically all we can do, because we cannot turn back the clock. On June 3, 1935, over 1,000 unemployed men began the \"On to Ottawa\" trek. They were frustrated and angry about their plight and determined to tell their political leaders and the nation that they deserved better. The trekkers made stops in Calgary, Medicine Hat, Swift Current, and Moose Jaw before arriving in Regina. At Regina a delegation of eight men was chosen and sent to Ottawa to meet with the Prime Minister. These talks failed. After attempts were made to arrest the leaders of the trek the situation deteriorated rapidly, leading to the Regina riot. By the end of it one policeman was dead, several dozen protesters, constables, and bystanders were injured, and 130 protesters were arrested. The events of July 1, 1935 were incredibly traumatic and they stand out in the pages of our history. What then did the trek accomplish? What lessons can we continue to draw from it today? I think we can draw a number of lessons. First, it is vital that we do not put ideology ahead of people's needs. Governments should never let adherence to a particular ideology or fear of a particular ideology blind it to the real needs of the people. Some parties in the House should take that message to heart. Another lesson of the trek is that if we as a society aspire to economic prosperity and social peace, we have to encourage the involvement of citizens. People have to take advantage of the opportunity to act through anti-poverty groups, social organizations and trade unions. We hear a lot of union bashing by right wingers these days, but it is a simple matter of fact that free societies and free trade unions go hand in hand. Societies that do not have a vigorous union movement challenging them to examine and re-examine their policies and attitudes are sorely lacking. The sweeping economic and social policy changes that we saw in Canada after World War II came about because the people demanded change to the status quo. These demands were translated into effective policies. Without people who agitate-and that is probably how I would classify my colleague across the way-criticize governments, challenge policies and organize their fellow citizens we would stagnate. We would not have made the progress we have in Canada. It is because of the challenges issued by the trekkers and others that we have built up social policies that go hand in hand with economic growth and prosperity. For example, there is free universal health care. Not only is it socially enlightened but it gives Canadian businesses a competitive advantage. Medicare has reduced the cost of health care to the economy and has left more money in the pockets of individuals and businesses. Similarly, good and balanced labour legislation that acknowledges the rights and needs of trade unions promotes stability in the workplace, improves productivity, maintains purchasing power and results in the creation of pension funds that are then accessed for both public and private investment. I could give other examples but I think I have made my point. Our collective experience with hard economic times, an experience that includes the \"On to Ottawa\" trek, has given us a certain perspective on social policy, a particular view of the meaning and purpose of social programs. In the short term the \"On to Ottawa\" trek probably did not accomplish much. In the bigger picture, though, it represents a shift in attitude. The work of the trekkers and other activists of the era contributed significantly to the rise of the Canadian labour movement. The trek did not create a formal organization but it created stirrings among the unemployed and among workers. It created the conditions in which the labour movement could grow. Before a strong labour movement could take root, working people had to become conscious of their power, their value and their dignity. The \"On to Ottawa\" trek led to this awareness. Since then unions have become a major force in Canadian society. Unlike the United States where only 10 per cent of the workforce is organized, unions here are relatively healthy and represent about 30 per cent of workers in Canada. Canadian society has developed in large part because of the work and prodding of trade unions. I value and appreciate the role they play in Canada. I have a significant bias as that is what I used to do for a living before I came to this place. The labour movement of today owes a lot to the \"On to Ottawa\" trekkers and to all other men and women who struggled to make the Canadian society more just, compassionate and democratic. With the rise of the labour movement came new labour legislation. A milestone was PC order 1003 in 1944 which put into law the right of workers to join unions and to engage in collective bargaining. That was not all that long ago. Since then governments have adopted a number of laws involving work standards, workplace health and safety, and worker protection. I am proud our laws are much more progressive and responsive to working people than the laws in the United States. In order that our laws continue to reflect and meet the needs of today's workforce we are in the process of a comprehensive review of the Canada Labour Code. In the spring we anticipate presenting legislation to the House for all members to consider. Our goal is to ensure a balanced system that benefits all of us. Again I thank the member for introducing the motion. It reflects on how difficult times were for millions of Canadians 60 years ago. The changes the trekkers were trying to achieve was time well spent. It gives us an appreciation of how far we have come in working together to create conditions for social peace. This is a heritage we have to protect so that working Canadians can continue to build the country and continue to create opportunities for all. I agree with members opposite who have spoken before me that we cannot go back in time to try to understand why people did what they did. However we can learn from our mistakes and we can advance as we have in the country. As I have mentioned, let us hope the lessons we have learned from the trekkers will be put into legislation. They will always have a place in our hearts and our history simply because they helped to start the labour movement in Canada.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19951102-1266.10.1.9", "topic": "Private Members' Business", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Simon de Jong", "party": "New Democratic Party", "date": "1995-11-02", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the members of the House for giving me this opportunity of closing the debate. I do wish to thank the member for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso for being a seconder, in that way allowing the motion to be introduced today and allowing the debate. Since there was no member of my party here, his gracious action in allowing his name to be used to second the motion is greatly appreciated. I recognize as well that when he did that, he did not necessarily endorse everything in the motion, nor all the comments I would make. Despite what some hon. members say, we cannot rectify the past. We cannot mend broken bones nor can we raise up the dead, but I think it is important that in some instances we say that what was done back then was wrong. We should do it in an official way by extending an apology. To me it then becomes a signpost in the evolution of our civilization. A formal act of this Parliament, for example apologizing and stating that what occurred in the Regina riot was wrong, becomes a signpost in our evolution. I hope as well that what some of the hon. members particularly from the government side have stated is true, that there is a great difference between conditions then and now. Indeed, there are many differences. but the fear of many of us is that we are sliding into situations quite similar to the last depression. That was one of the reasons I also wished to bring this item up. While there are differences, unfortunately there are also growing similarities, particularly the sense of hopelessness many of our young people feel, the lack of jobs, the lack of a future, the lack of opportunity. Surely those young men in those camps must also have felt a sense of hopelessness for the future which motivated them to start the trek to Ottawa to bring to the attention of Parliament the conditions which existed. I hope those conditions will never return again. The reality is however that many of our young Canadian citizens face the future not with hope and aspirations, but with dejection and unemployment. I hope the government and this Parliament will remember what the Bennett government did back then and will reject it as a solution to the problems we face. I hope that we will work together toward a new solution to the problem.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19951109-1271.3.2.11", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Francine Lalonde", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "1995-11-09", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, the minister who tabled the bill implies that his bill is a model of flexibility, co-ordination, decentralization, and letting the average citizen decide. Unfortunately, that is not the case, since it all depends on whether the minister is prepared to say yes or no to a project, any project. In the final analysis, the minister will decide what will be decentralized, who will get a grant, who may co-ordinate, because ultimately, the decision will always be his. This bill is the exact opposite of flexible. This bill is unbending, and its author did not listen to Quebec. Coming ten days after a referendum in which the people of Quebec spoke loud and clear, while giving Canada a brief respite to shape up, this bill is an insult. It is easy for the minister to say: Let us set prerogatives and jurisdictions aside and co-operate, when in this legislation he assumes powers he never had under the constitution, powers he had the colossal nerve to extrapolate from his spending powers and which he today wants to legalize in a bill. With complete disregard for efficiency in the use of shrinking resources and for the constitution, this bill for the first time clearly gives the federal Minister of Human Resources Development the power to replace the provinces in many of their jurisdictions, since, and we will see this later on, it literally allows the minister, as it says in the clause, to make decisions on all matters relating to human resources development in Canada, no less. Far from withdrawing from provincial jurisdictions, the federal government is in fact assuming general responsibility for human resources development. The federal government is assuming the powers it needs, whether the provinces like it or not, although some do, but that is another matter and we will get back to that, but Quebec was not consulted, and when it was, it said in no uncertain terms what it wanted. The federal government is getting ready to change the social safety net, with no regard for the impact this will have on the provinces and especially on the individuals concerned. This is a new phase, a qualitative leap in the development of Canadian federalism which tries to provide a legislative basis for this invasion by the federal government's spending power. The government has decided unilaterally to provide a legal, specific and positive basis for its spending power, which it often used to spend its way into debt. Today, the debt is being decentralized to the provinces, but the power has been recentralized to Ottawa. This confirms our worst fears, and we discussed this during the referendum campaign. For instance, instead of announcing a withdrawal of the federal presence from manpower, this bill accentuates that presence by giving the federal government the requisite powers to negotiate and make deals directly with local agencies, without prior consent from the provinces. That is what the minister calls being flexible. Even municipalities may be approached and offered responsibilities under contracts to be concluded directly with the Department of Human Resources Development. A good example is what happened during the so-called battle of the employment centres. We have yet to hear the epilogue to this story. Bill C-96 throws wide open the door to the delegation of the powers entrusted to the minister or the new employment and insurance commission-I will get back to this-to entities other than provincial governments and public administrations. In other words, this bill, without any consultations, also opens the door to privatization and contracting out. Again, this is to be done on the minister's say so; if this bill is passed, he will be in a position to adopt any standards he wants and to define expected results. All those involved-including provinces, if he feels like it, organizations, people and financial institutions-will have to be totally flexible in complying with his decisions. This will remain true even though he says he wants to make employment centres responsible for some programs, since these centres will also be accountable to the minister. If Bill C-96 is passed, it will also put in place the legislative framework allowing the Minister of Human Resources Development to go ahead with his UI reform according to the policy outlines revealed in the past few days. This policy is fully consistent with the bill. I would like to stress a disturbing fact. This bill, whose only purpose, according to the minister, is to join together previously separate departments or programs, is Kim Campbell's legacy to the Liberals. It is important to remember that, during her short-lived government, she gathered under the same roof all departments dealing with unemployment insurance, income security for both seniors and young people, literacy, student loans, employment training, and family policies. She did this as part of a major reform of social programs, as she said during the election campaign. Over 50 per cent of the federal government's budget spending is done, decided, directed, and controlled by this new Department of Human Resources Development. The Tories did not hide the fact that they wanted to carry out a comprehensive reform. Let us not forget that, during the following election campaign, Liberal candidate Chr\u00e9tien hounded the minister for saying, and we remember this, that this issue was too complex to be debated during an election campaign. When questioned, the Liberals never suggested that they were only waiting to be elected before doing what Kim Campbell wanted to do. It is important to keep this in mind. It is important to show that when the Liberals came to power, instead of putting the departments back the way they were, they took advantage of the major upheaval ordered by senior officials who are still there. This clearly shows that the Liberal policy is the same as the old Tory policy, which is the same as that proposed in 1985 by the Macdonald Commission set up, as we know, by Mr. Trudeau's Liberal government. Let us have a look-and I will quote the minister himself-at the new department's jurisdiction. In his budget plan tabled on February 27, 1995, he said that Human Resources Development Canada was in charge of the UI program, the income security program for children and seniors, a major part of family policy, existing federal programs of assistance to the provinces for post-secondary education and social assistance, labour market adjustment, social development and student loans. This accounts for more than 50 per cent of federal expenditures. The federal government is playing a major role in the daily lives of Canadians without having to consult anyone, when it is literally altering the social and economic picture in Canada. But Quebec should be left to get organized to look after the people let down by the federal government. Quebec is expected to live with the consequences of this government's actions, that is to say, at a time when, as we know, deficits are high, let the middle class bear the brunt of the tax load, target assistance to the most disadvantaged, eventually creating a rather difficult situation, all this without being required in any way to consult the Quebec government, which is the only government representing the people and nation of Quebec. Must we remind members that a people that is different from others sets up its own social, economic, cultural and political structure that is not necessarily better but different, based on its priorities and its needs. Merely ten days after the October 30 vote, what Bill C-96 is saying is that the central government, through the Minister of Human Resources Development, will go ahead with its plans for reform and keep making decisions affecting the social fabric of Quebec without having to consult anyone. No wonder it is telling us: \"Forget jurisdictions. It does not matter any more\". It is taking over, making an unprecedented power grab in areas of responsibility that are not its own, by misusing its spending power to provide direction, decide, take charge. Let us take a look at some clauses. The people have the right to know. The bill reads, in part: \"The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to-they can say that again-and include all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of the human resources of Canada-that is an even wider area than the specific ones I mentioned-not by law assigned to any other Minister, department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be exercised with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality and promoting social security\". The federal government is trying to take over from the Government of Quebec a very wide and ill defined area of responsibility, human resources development. It never had that power. True, unemployment insurance legislation was put in place, but that required a constitutional amendment. Unemployment insurance and UI benefits are one thing, but we know that the government never had the power to decide and to provide direction it is now claiming over manpower training. Quite the contrary. And what about family policy, poverty, literacy, dropouts? The government first used its spending power to interfere, and now it is making this intrusion legal. Let us move to clause 7. There is no requirement to do so. Indeed, if you look at clause 20, it reads: For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, coordination and implementation of any program or policy-the Minister may enter into agreements with a province-agencies of provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as the Minister considers appropriate. The minister decides whether or not he wants to hold consultations. He can delegate any power to the Minister of Labour, the commission or any other person or body he chooses. This is important, because the desire to take over the provinces' responsibility for their own fields of jurisdiction has, as we know, a different impact on Quebec than it does on the other provinces. A debate seems to be taking place outside Quebec concerning the social program reform, or a reform of federalism. Some want to maintain centralization, while others are in favour of decentralization. We understand that, but we want to say this: those who think that there is a will on this government's part to decentralize should open their eyes and their ears, and they should read these provisions. They will realize that what is in the making is not decentralization but, on the contrary, what one might call recentralization. Indeed, the central government is giving itself the means to directly decide what will happen at the local level. It is easy for the minister to say: \"Yes, citizen A or citizen B will be able to decide to-\" That is not the case. The minister is the one who will really make the decision. He is the one who will decide and it will not be possible for a province wishing to integrate its programs to do so. We will let the debate proceed, but we had to make this point. As for Quebec, it has been fighting Ottawa's centralizing views for a long time, because it conflicts with its own desire to have a well-adjusted or co-ordinated, as Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque used to say, social and economic policy. Let me just mention that, before the Second World War, the Rowell-Sirois commission began preparing the ground-and would later complete the process-to ensure that, in Canada, major budgetary social and economic decisions would all be taken by Ottawa, with the provinces becoming mere flexible subcontractors. The bill introduced by the human resources development minister is not new but is certainly in line with the recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois commission. However, succeeding governments in Quebec have always fought hard to maintain control over the province's social and economic development. The war helped the central government, by allowing it to centralize all taxes. Once it had a foot in the door, Ottawa would not back out. In Quebec, the public, co-operative organizations, as well as grass-roots movements, created a coalition, somewhat like the one which we witnessed during the referendum campaign, and told then premier Duplessis: \"Quebec needs its own taxes\". That tax is what allowed the then exuberant Quiet Revolution to be channelled into specific projects. At the federal-provincial conference on poverty in 1965, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, who was to become the first sovereignist premier of Quebec and was then a federalist minister in a Liberal government, gave a very clear explanation of what the position of his federalist Liberal government was at the time. I quoted him in relation to Bill C-95 but, if you will allow me, I shall repeat the quotes here for the benefit of our audience and for argument's sake. I do so for the simple reason that they show that Quebec has made no progress between 1965 and 1995 in controlling its own future. It has regressed. Quebecers have seen their situation worsen. Concretely-applying it to manpower-the people find themselves face to face with two levels of decision-making, to their disadvantage. Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque said that it had become imperative to establish a genuine economic and social policy. This policy needed to be integrated, flexible in its mechanisms, include a social security system centred on the family and be based on the right to assistance on the basis of need. Secondly, he said, for the sake of efficiency and on constitutional grounds, the Quebec government alone could and should, within its own territory, design and implement such a policy. I repeat, for the sake of efficiency first, and on constitutional grounds. Thirdly, L\u00e9vesque said, the social and economic development policy they had formulated would create an integrated social policy-I would interject here that the foregoing is the key phrase-regional development policy, manpower policy, health policy, housing policy and job training policy. Finally, he said that, as a federalist, the general policy, while he did not necessarily condemn it, did not necessarily correspond, in terms of its spirit and terms of application, to one the Government of Canada might opt for. The people of Quebec would enjoy at least as many if not more benefits than other Canadians might. For the sake of efficiency, for the sake of determining economic and social policy as a function of needs and priorities, at a time when money is scarce, it is urgent for Quebec's economic and social policy to be integrated. Nothing, however, could be further from integration than this Bill C-96, which makes the Minister of Human Resources Development the key figure in that organization, as he has so aptly said himself. In the manpower field in particular, there is unanimity in Quebec, and this has been expressed by another resolution by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de d\u00e9veloppement de la main-d'oeuvre, which comprises banking co-operatives, school boards, the Conseil du patronat, along with municipal institutions, co-operative businesses-just about everybody, you might say. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de d\u00e9veloppement de la main-d'oeuvre, on the proposal of Mr. B\u00e9land and with the support of Ghislain Dufour, made a unanimous decision to ask the government-the federal government to be precise-not to put in place a parallel partnership structure or try to interfere with Quebec's jurisdiction over manpower development. The board also indicated that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de d\u00e9veloppement de la main-d'oeuvre is and must remain the favoured partnership structure regarding Quebec manpower issues. Must I remind the House that this organization is not a government organization, but one whose members represent private groups. This is the organization through which the manpower policy is implemented. It stresses, almost imploringly, that the federal government is set to put in place another network, adding an extra level of consultation, decision and assessment. This is not a reflection of the central government's will to eliminate duplication and overlap, but of its will to take over everywhere, pushing the provinces aside and sidelining Quebec. Because it must be borne in mind that the cutbacks announced in relation to the Canada social transfer will result, in 1997-98, in a $1.9 billion shortfall on top of all the other cuts. Quebec is going to go through some rough times. Meanwhile, the central government and its HRD minister are letting UI fund surpluses accumulate, so that they can play Santa Claus by going over the Quebec government's head and spend this money in provincial areas of jurisdiction. But contributions to the UI fund come directly from employers and workers. The minister of employment and consultation herself vigorously denounced his bill. She says that: \"Like its labour market partners, the Quebec government denounces Ottawa's intentions to set up its own parallel manpower structures in Quebec. This federal initiative amounts to a flat rejection of the unanimous Quebec consensus, repeatedly expressed, both under the previous administration and under the current one, on the need for Quebec to regain control over all labour adjustment measures, including the related budgets\". Lise Bissonnette referred, in several editorials, to this increased desire to interfere, the term is not strong enough because the federal really wants to assume Quebec's power to make its own political and economic decisions. This is not the first attempt by the central government to bypass the Quebec government and manpower corporation. Former minister Valcourt tried to do the same. Remember who told him off? None other than Liberal minister Bourbeau, also a federalist, who said: \"Your commission does offer grants to what it calls co-ordination groups for all sorts of projects, directly or indirectly related to manpower training. These groups include all kinds of associations. Such projects seem relatively pertinent, but others are more questionable\". He then said: \"Obviously, this is a new structure used by the federal government to spend money which comes primarily from the UI fund\". He also added: \"What is unacceptable with this approach is that it is totally improvised, this at a time when, more than ever, government intervention in the manpower development sector must be planned according to priorities, so as to deal efficiently with issues such as manpower shortage, retraining in growing economic sectors, as well as improvement of skills, and thus benefit from market globalization\". Minister Bourbeau continued by saying: \"I find it hard to believe that the federal government would wilfully do things which, under the pretence of initiating a rapprochement with the private sector, would result in the establishment of a network of intermediaries, given that it pledged it would not do such a thing\". I only alluded to manpower training because it is a very sensitive issue at a time when Quebec is, sadly, the champion of poverty, with an unemployment rate still at 11.2 per cent, and with Montreal in 23rd place, out of 26 Canadian cities, in terms of income level. We, Bloc Quebecois members, will do everything possible to ensure that Quebec does not remain in that situation. Less than 10 days after the referendum, instead of listening to us, they impose with an iron hand diktats that do not meet Quebec's economic and social needs and priorities. Madam Speaker, I move, seconded by the hon. member for La Prairie: That all words following the word \"That\" be deleted and replaced with the following: \"this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-96, An Act to establish the Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain related Acts, because the principle of the Bill includes no provision requiring the Minister, as part of that person's powers, to award full and entire financial compensation to any province wishing to exercise, fully and alone, jurisdiction over human resources development.\" If the government would only give a sign that it has heard Quebecers' majority vote calling unanimously for major changes, especially with respect to manpower. It could have given a sign. By moving second reading of this utterly offensive bill, the government shows no concern for efficiency and integration, for Quebec's need to co-ordinate all its resources at a difficult time, for the Constitution, for the wishes expressed once again by 100 per cent of Quebecers. Consideration of this bill will allow us to say that this dialogue of the deaf, which has been going on for so long and which hurts both Quebec and probably Canada, must end. Should Canada, however, end the dialogue by refusing to listen, Quebecers know which way they must go to take control of their own destiny. In the interests of the whole population of Quebec, of the whole Quebec nation, Quebecers have shown the way that they will have no choice but to follow.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19950329-1191.4.1.3", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Fran\u00e7ois Langlois", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "1995-03-29", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, the process the final stage of which is being undertaken today started yesterday, more than a year after the introduction in this House of Bill C-18, which suspended the electoral redistribution process then under way and provided for a 24 month waiting period before starting a new debate on redistribution. Unfortunately, the Reform Party then opposed Bill C-18 and the 24 month delay initially provided under this bill. However, the House of Commons passed the bill suspending the whole electoral redistribution process for 24 months. Later, in considering Bill C-18, the Senate did exactly what the Reform Party wanted to do in this House. It moved an amendment to Bill C-18 providing that a new bill had to be tabled by June 1995; otherwise, the old law would apply again, reviving the commissions suspended under Bill C-18. When the bill came back from the Senate, the government should have stood up and affirmed the will of the people represented by the hon. members in this place by approving the bill as presented and with the relevant amendments adopted in this House. Yet, the government then chose to go along with a Senate amendment that put us in a tight squeeze by reducing the amount of time available to do our work. It was, in my opinion, an unacceptable concession, which the Reform Party managed to secure through the Senate. Following final passage and Royal Assent of Bill C-18, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs was given the mandate to draft a bill to be submitted to the House. We worked on this for a very long time. I attended all the sessions, including those in the summer of 1994, in July 1994, in which we heard a great many witnesses, including political party representatives, hon. members of this House who came to testify, university experts and others. While working on this bill, we enjoyed the continuous collaboration of the Chief Electoral Officer and his staff. Although we spent a lot of time on this bill, we have precious little to show for it. Of course, the bill before us, Bill C-69, contains a few sweeteners. These sweeteners are improvements compared with the present situation. For instance, the provincial commissions will now be able to hold hearings before proceeding with their task, which is clearly an improvement on the current situation. The commissions will have to produce three maps for the regions they cover, three electoral redistribution proposals. If there is sufficient popular demand, the commissions will have to hold new hearings. Granted, the process was improved in this regard. The bill also sets out the factors to be considered by the commissions in establishing electoral ridings. These considerations or factors are described in subparagraph 19(2)( b ), which states that, in determining reasonable electoral district boundaries, the provincial commission shall consider the following: first, the community of interest; second, a manageable geographic size for districts in sparsely populated, rural or northern regions of the province; third, the probability that there will be a substantial increase in the population of electoral districts in the next five years. And finally, the commission shall recommend changes to existing electoral district boundaries only where the above-mentioned factors are sufficiently significant to warrant such a recommendation. It is all fine and well to make a policy statement like that, making community of interest a guiding principle for every commission. However, we inevitably come across another provision, which sets the maximum variance from the provincial electoral quota at 25 per cent. For example, if, in Quebec, the provincial quota was 100,000 voters or a population of 100,000, the commission would be entitled to make electoral districts with up to 125,000 voters but no less than 75,000 or equivalent population. The commission may observe a community of interest, but note that the number of voters is not significant enough. Let us not take an hypothetical case, but a real one. At present, the population of the electoral district of Bonaventure-\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine is 43 per cent below the provincial quota of 50,000 or 51,000, but encompasses a huge area. This district is at risk; it may actually be eliminated. While this bill allows the commissions not to apply this 25 per cent rule rigidly, the considerations are so restrictive that I wonder if they will ever be able to do so. The only time a provincial commission can depart from this rule is when, as mentioned in paragraph 19(3), an electoral riding or district is geographically isolated from the rest of the province or is not easily accessible. Who will define \"geographically isolated\"? The commissions, to start with, and of course the courts. No definition was provided. I consider the Magdalen Islands geographically isolated. No one will deny that. Will the population factor apply? I suggest that the commissions consider this factor. Magdalen Islanders had their own electoral district up until 1968. Under Quebec law, they are guaranteed their own district. It is not that the hon. member for Bonaventure-\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine is not doing a good job at representing the district, but I think it would be highly desirable to have a member of Parliament just for the Magdalen Islands. Magdalen Islanders will argue that they are geographically isolated, and I think that they can qualify under that factor. Then it will be a matter of satisfying the provincial commissions that the population of the islands does not vary too greatly to justify the creation of a separate district. But I can see a downside to this. While the new electoral district of Magdalen Islands gains a member of Parliament, the district of Bonaventure shrinks in terms of voters ratio. What will happen to the Gaspesian Peninsula then? What becomes of the ridings of Gasp\u00e9, Matap\u00e9dia-Matane, Bonaventure-\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine and Rimouski-T\u00e9miscouata? What do we do? There is a problem in the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula. Does clause 19(3) allow us to deal with it globally? I am not sure. We need more information. This is a region with a dwindling population where MPs, whatever their political allegiance, have a large area to cover. They must cope with problems that do not exist, or that take a very different form, elsewhere in the province or in the country. The Gasp\u00e9 peninsula is the first thing that concerns me. Maybe clause 19(3) will apply to the riding of Manicouagan, which is indeed geographically isolated and particularly inaccessible, as my hon. friend from Manicouagan argued so convincingly before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and again here in the House at the report stage, if memory serves. Maybe it will also apply to the northern regions of Quebec and Ontario. Last Monday, the ridings of Cochrane-Superior and Nickel Belt in northern Ontario were mentioned. They cover a vast area and their population, with certain exceptions, is generally on the decline. Will the division be made strictly on the basis of the numbers? Will a greater deviation be allowed? Clause 19(3) is much too restrictive, in my opinion, for us to give it our approval. We had suggested maintaining, in the bill before us, criteria now being used by the provincial commissions when deciding whether to waive the rules. What are these criteria? At the present time, a provincial commission may waive the 25 per cent criterion in any case where any special community or diversity of interests of the inhabitants of various regions of the province appears to the commission to render such waiving necessary or desirable. In other words, the provincial commissions now have a much broader criterion when looking at particular cases. I think that a region like the Gasp\u00e9 or the Magdalen Islands, even the Lower St. Lawrence, would have benefited much more under this criterion than under the extremely restrictive wording being proposed to replace it. This may not be as bad as the initial suggestion to include a schedule of the ridings in the act and freeze them, thus giving a form of statism to the act and to the list of ridings and making it extremely difficult to work with. Consequently, the official opposition considers clause 19 to be a major obstacle and cannot support the bill. Clause 16 is also questionable and even unacceptable, given what it says and what it does not say. Following the representations made last summer to the Standing Committee on the Procedure and House Affairs-by the hon. member for M\u00e9gantic-Compton-Stanstead, by the president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and, previously, on June 21, by Senator Jean-Claude Rivest of the Stadacona senatorial designation-we understood that the government would be receptive to the traditional request made by Quebecers and their government for guaranteed minimum representation in the House of Commons, as is the case for some Atlantic provinces. As you know, representation for the Atlantic provinces is guaranteed by the senatorial clause, which dates back to 1915 and which we do not question. The senatorial clause allows a population of 120,000 people in Prince Edward Island to be represented by four members in this House. Indeed, that clause provides that a province cannot be represented by fewer members in the House of Commons than senators in the Senate. Since four Senate seats are guaranteed to Prince Edward Island in the senatorial clause, that province can also be represented by four members in this House. The same rule applies for New Brunswick, which is guaranteed ten seats in the Senate, under the Canadian Constitution. Although the number of residents in that province does not justify such representation, New Brunswick gets ten seats and we accept that. The terms of union between Newfoundland and the Canadian federation, ratified in 1949, also contained provisions guaranteeing adequate representation of the province of Newfoundland, both in the House of Commons and in the Senate. In fact, Newfoundland was guaranteed six seats in the Canadian Senate. So if we agree with the senatorial clause that provides guarantees for Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, why are we up against a wall when we talk about the same guarantees for the Province of Quebec, when we talk about a minimum level of representation for Quebec? Quebec, which as a people and as a nation, is one of the two founding peoples of this country. We are told this time and time again. We learned this from our history teachers. It is part of our collective conscience as Quebecers that in 1867, Quebecers were one of the two founding peoples. I may recall that on June 30, 1867, the day before the coming into force of the British North America Act, 1867, Quebec, then known as Lower Canada, was entitled to 65 seats out of a total of 130 in the Parliament of the Province of Canada, that is, 50 per cent. This was agreed to by the members who were elected to represent us at the time-there was no referendum to ask what the people of Quebec thought and certainly not the women of Quebec, since they did not even have the right to vote at the time and the Fathers of the Confederation were all males-but there were no constitutional provisions that provided for minimum representation for Quebec. The only guarantee Quebec obtained was those 65 seats, but 65 out of how many? On July 1, 1867, it was 65 seats out of 181. Later, when Canada's territory was expanded with the addition of new provinces including Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and finally Newfoundland, Quebec's share of representation in the House of Commons dropped steadily, stabilizing during the past 20 or 30 years at a level slightly over one-quarter. Obviously, the Fathers of Confederation made a mistake by not including a minimum representation clause for Quebec, which at the time should have been 50 per cent. We can hardly rewrite history and today insist on 50 per cent. People will say: Who do you think you are? We are not in a country that allows such deviations from the norm. Be that as it may, we are not asking for the representation that we had in 1867, in other words, 50 per cent. We asked for a minimum guarantee of 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. In the next general election, should Quebec participate-my good friend from Bonaventure-\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine will agree it is pretty doubtful that we will be able to-when the thirty-sixth Parliament is elected, Quebec, for the first time in its history, will fall below this critical mass of 25 per cent, since it will have only 75 seats out of 301. Hence our proposal, which was akin to the Liberal 1992 proposal. I read on Monday of the pleasure of the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel and Minister of Foreign Affairs at being able to guarantee Quebec minimum representation of 25 per cent, saying that this represented a significant gain for Quebec. The hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel described the guarantee of 25 per cent for Quebec as an incredible step forward. Well, as regards our motion which was voted on yesterday, once again none of the Liberal members in this House in 1992, who are still here today, voted in favour. Why did the members change their minds in the space of three years? Why deny Quebec something so minor? I would like, in passing, to recognize the very open-minded approach to the matter taken by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway, who voted with the official opposition to guarantee Quebec minimum representation of 25 per cent, as did the hon. member for Beauce, as if this were perfectly natural. It was perfectly natural, since the vast majority of members from Quebec present in this House yesterday voted in favour of this minimum guarantee of 25 per cent. We can therefore say that there is very broad consensus in Quebec, which goes beyond party lines, that Quebec should enjoy a minimum guarantee of 25 per cent. When the Progressive Conservative Party, the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway and the independent member for Beauce all support the motion to include guaranteed representation of 25 per cent in Bill C-69, it is obvious that there is broad support in Quebec on this point. I need not add that Senator Rivest had given his support for this provision. Even the support of the governments of Quebec, which had called for the inclusion of this provision in the legislation, did not fail. As far as I know, as well, the present government never shied away from what had been agreed in the past. It is strange to see the government back away from something it supported in September 1992-the vote was on September 10, 1992-without much justification. Two days ago, on Monday, I listened to the arguments which the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands and the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River put forward, arguments which were not convincing. I do admit, however, that under normal circumstances, these two people are extremely convincing, but, for people to be able to convince others, they themselves must be convinced. It goes without saying that, when people rise to make representations that they are forced to make-because any old reason to vote against the amendment will do-they obviously cannot be convincing. The unconvinced cannot be convincing. This was the impression that I got the other day from the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, the impression that he did not believe in the things that he was saying and that he was using the pretext of constitutional technicalities as a reason for refusing to support a motion which had already been allowed by the Chair and declared admissible following a procedural debate. It is a little odd that the debate swung in this direction. You will understand therefore, that, at the end of the day, this bill will be incomplete, as I said earlier, because of its stand on the issue of allowable deviations from the boundary rules in special ridings and because of its failure to take a stand on the issue of one of the country's founding peoples. Was this an intentional omission on the part of the government? We might have asked ourselves this question when debate began on the bill. But, after the vote yesterday on the official opposition's motion guaranteeing Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House, it was quite clear that the government had not simply overlooked this detail, but that it was omitted by design. The government does not want to guarantee Quebec fair representation in this House and does not want to accept as a criterion the fact that the nation of francophones in Quebec is a founding people, the cradle of francophones in America. The day we took such a decision was a very sad day indeed. Would Canadians have been unhappy to see the government finally recognize Quebec's distinct society status, founding people status, status as a nation which built this country? I think not. Yet, yesterday, all it would have taken to recognize this was a majority vote in this House. But it was denied us. It was the most modest demand formulated in the last 50 years. Without going back to prehistory, we can go back several decades: in the 1930s, there was the Rowell-Sirois commission in Quebec; in the 1950s, the Tremblay commission also studied constitutional issues; the Laurendeau-Dunton commission reviewed what was happening in this country in terms of the Constitution. I invite our friends from the Reform Party, who think that Canadian history started with their election, to read about the events of that period. It would be a good idea to return to the source to understand that Canadian history started, we are not sure exactly when, with the first people to land on our shores, probably the Vikings who landed somewhere near Newfoundland at the beginning of the millennium. Then there was the arrival of Jacques Cartier in Gasp\u00e9 in 1534, the founding of Quebec City by Samuel de Champlain in 1608, the founding of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and Montreal in the following decades. And finally, the establishment of the first government in New France, as Canada was then called. In the beginning, we had a government of companies. As you probably remember, the King of France entrusted private companies like the Company of One Hundred Associates and the Dutch West India Company with the administration of the territory. The King of England, for his part, gave the Hudson's Bay Company the English part of the territory that later became British North America. Territories throughout the continent were administered by private companies. Our first institutions, not democratic but public, were granted in 1663 by the King of France through the establishment of the Sovereign Council of New France. These institutions reflected the values of the time: a governor, an intendant, the Bishop of Quebec City and those co-opted by them for a total of seven people, near the end of colonial times, but without any democratic guarantees. We, francophones, had a hard time achieving our democratic rights on the American continent. Our motherland never gave them to us. They tried to exercise in New France the same absolute domination as in Old France. Gradually, we stopped being French while, of course, maintaining good relations with what was then our mother or home country and became a more and more distinct nation. At first, we called ourselves Canadiens or, as we used say, \"Canayens\". So, on one side, there was us Canadiens and, on the other, the English who occupied part of the land. From 1663 to 1759, we operated with these institutions. Then, in 1759, the battle that took place on the Plains of Abraham was a victory for some, but for us it was a defeat. It brought about constitutional changes, again, military government in 1759, a royal proclamation in 1763 which ceded the colony of New France to England in exchange for Guadeloupe and Martinique. It is clear that errors of judgment were made somewhere along the way because, while anglophones had won here, in America, when, on the Old Continent, the British won the war against the French and the Treaty of Paris was signed, they got New France, but France kept Guadeloupe and Martinique. Those are great travel destinations, but in terms of the relative value of the two, I think it was a sucker deal at the time. Still no democratic institutions. In 1774, the Quebec Act that was handed to us-because we got whatever was left over-nonetheless restored civil law in Quebec, which allowed us to have a legislative council, but not an elected one. They were afraid to give francophones, so peace-loving, democratic institutions in which Quebecers could be represented by the people of their choice. Instead, we were given a legislative council appointed by the governor. But the Quebecers, Canadiens of those days had certainly demonstrated great pacifism and great open-mindedness because there were 63,000 francophones in Quebec at the time of the conquest and only 3,000 to 4,000 survivors of Wolfe's regiment. With that kind of power relationship, had we been even slightly vindictive, the slightest bit vindictive, we would not have had to go into overtime to decide the fate of these 3,000 or so people. We went along with a de facto situation and, guided by the elites who governed us in those days, whether we liked it or not-we will not rewrite history-we tolerated this situation. Finally, in 1791, the Constitutional Act gave us for the very first time the right to have elected representatives and the first House of Assembly in Quebec. Naturally, we did not take any chances. It is like in a car: there is an accelerator, but there is also a brake pedal. The Westminster government allowed us to have a house of assembly made up of elected members, but it also maintained a legislative council, which was appointed by the governor and which could oppose the decisions of the assembly. In 1791, we gained control over some institutions. The situation evolved rather rapidly and the country was divided into two parts: Upper Canada and Lower Canada. The assembly elected in Lower Canada had no extra-territorial jurisdiction. Consequently, it could not legislate for Upper Canada, nor could Upper Canada legislate for Lower Canada. We then move on to the 1830s with the Patriotes' rebellion and the infamous Durham report, which recommended unifying the two Canadas to finally assimilate and anglicize the French-speaking nation in America, something which was not to happen. For eight years, while English was the only official language in the house of assembly of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, French Canadians fought, in their own language, to have French recognized as an official language. Thanks to their tenacity, justice was finally done in 1848, when they obtained the right to use French, which also became the language used in the legislation. I will end with 1867 and the emergence of new institutions. You will understand, Mr. Speaker, why I simply cannot agree when I hear simplistic comments such as those made by the Reform Party, to the effect that Canada started to exist in October 1993. Canada has existed for a long time. As a member of one of the founding nations which forged Canada's Constitution, I respectfully submit that, given our long common history, this critical mass of 25 per cent is the breath of life which Quebec needs if it remains, but I hope it will not, part of the Canadian federation. In any case, it is better to be safe than sorry; it is better to buckle up, even if you do not wish to have an accident. It is from that perspective that I wanted to discuss the 25 per cent rule. This rule is so fundamental that, even though Bill C-69 includes some improvements, the fact that Quebec is not guaranteed a minimum of 25 per cent of the total representation in the House of Commons is reason enough, in fact the only reason, for the Bloc not to support this bill at third reading. Consequently, we will oppose this legislation.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19991015-2038.4.10.1", "topic": "Oral Question Period", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Charlie Penson", "party": "Reform", "date": "1999-10-15", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Alberta government recognized the worst farm crisis in Canada since the Great Depression by announcing a $100 million emergency farm program.

The World Trade Organization talks broke down in Seattle last year and it is a good thing they did. This hiatus gives us some time to reflect upon the Liberal government's blind pursuit of a trade agenda that has been destructive to our farmers. They are hostages of the government's cult-like adherence to the ideology of free trade at any cost. It is true the government's friends at the Business Council on National Issues repeat the mantra with zeal \u201cfree trade, free trade, free trade\u201d and our so-called national newspapers sing the same hymn \u201cglobalize, globalize, globalize\u201d. Our trade minister, our agriculture minister, our Prime Minister are all choirboys in the same chorus. People in my part of the country are asking interesting questions. They are saying that if this free trade is such a wonderful thing, then why are we, the grain farmers, in such dire straits today? Agriculture exports have increased by 65% over the past five years and farm receipts have increased by more than 43% over the last 10 years. Why is it in these circumstances that farmers' net income has actually dropped by 11%? Why are the very people whose hard work provides the statistics the government uses to promote its trade agenda losing their farms? During the Christmas break I visited some of the farm communities in my riding. I was told that one small community had lost four families since last fall and the prediction was that it would lose at least that many again before spring seeding. I have spoken with farmers, with their family members, with regional municipality councillors and reeves. Believe me, there is a very crucial need for some support and reinvestment in rural Canada, especially in western Canada. It is time for the government to come out of its trance and to realize that farmers in western Canada are paying the price for a warped trade agenda. They are paying with their farms, with the break-up of their families and some tragically with their lives as they are unable to bear the stress any longer. Canadian farmers, in particular those who grow grains, are facing the worst situation since the Great Depression. The government's own income statistics and forecasts tell us that the next five years will not be any easier for the thousands of families that put bread on our tables. For farmers in my province of Saskatchewan the news is grim. Incomes for 2001, 2002 and 2003 will be below zero in the negative range. If the Seattle talks had gone as the faceless WTO bureaucrats had wanted, our farmers would have been even more vulnerable to the cold winds of international trade. Since 1993 our federal government has cut its support for grain farmers by 60% all in the name of liberalized trade. My colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I have been calling for the government to set aside $1 billion from the $100 billion forecast surplus for the next five years, a mere 1% of that, to pay for some support to farm families who need it terribly badly. Canadian farmers represent a mere 3% of our population. Through their hard work they support about 14% of our jobs and one-quarter of our trade surplus, but they are asking why they do not benefit from it. We are saying that it is the government's responsibility to see that they do benefit from it rather than being left to twist in the wind.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19991117-2057.7.1.37", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "John Harvard", "party": "Liberal", "date": "1999-11-17", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the distinguished member for Winnipeg North\u2014St. Paul. It gives me great pleasure to address the House in reply to the recent Speech from the Throne. I am a proud member of the club of 1988. November 21 will mark my 11th anniversary as a member of the House, representing the voters in the west end of Winnipeg first for the riding of Winnipeg\u2014St. James and now, following redistribution in 1997, the riding of Charleswood St. James\u2014Assiniboia. In those 11 years I have witnessed much change, most of it for the better. I spent my first five years on the opposition benches during the Mulroney years. I am quite sure you remember them well, Mr. Speaker, even though you were not here. I recall the letters and phone calls I received in those days. People were down on their federal government, and some of them were even down on their country. There were issues like the divisive constitutional changes proposed at Meech Lake and Charlottetown, the bitter debate over free trade, the soaring deficit and debt, and an economic recession thrown in for good measure. All those issues left many Canadians feeling pessimistic about their futures. In late 1993 the country changed for the better with the election of a new government, bringing in a new approach and some new directions. The new Liberal government embarked on an ambitious plan to put Canadians back to work and to restore stability and credibility to the nation's finances. We have worked hard to rebuild the foundations of Canada. We have worked hard to restore the confidence of Canadians in the future. I am proud to say that in short order the government transformed the record deficit of $42 billion that we inherited from our predecessors to two consecutive balanced budgets, with a third on the way, and a growing budget surplus. As a result interest rates have fallen sharply, driving the economy to create, it is hard to believe, nearly two million jobs since we took office in the fall of 1993. In my province of Manitoba the federal government's economic policies have helped push the unemployment rate down to 5.4%. That is one of the lowest in the country, if not the lowest. With the nation's finances firmly under control and the economy growing, the government has been able to make key reinvestments in social and economic programs. That is something Canadians want us to do. For example, research and development funding has been boosted significantly. Health care funding has been increased by $11.5 billion, of which my province of Manitoba will receive $425 million. We have improved support for those pursuing post-secondary education through changes to the tax system and by introducing the millennium scholarship fund. Our infrastructure renewal programs have seen some $6 billion invested across the country improving everything from community centres to highways, including a number of projects in my riding of Charleswood St. James\u2014Assiniboia. Despite what the opposition may want Canadians to believe, we have begun cutting taxes in the last three budgets, or effectively over the past three budgets, to about $16.5 billion. Average families in my riding earning $50,000 will see their federal taxes fall by $550. This is only the beginning. We stand today before a new century confident in the future of our country. All Canadians can be proud of our achievements as an independent and prosperous country with a dynamic economy and a strong and democratic society. As the United Nations consistently reminds us, Canada is the best place to live in the world. That declaration has come from the United Nations for the last six years. Canadians are confident that despite a rapidly changing world where technology, knowledge and creativity are the driving forces of the new economy, Canada will succeed. Maintaining and enhancing our standard of living require a comprehensive strategy to take us into the 21st century. The throne speech boldly sets out that strategy. The government's vision for the future includes a commitment to Canada's children and youth, which is a very good start; the building of a dynamic economy; further strengthening our health care system; ensuring the quality of our environment; building stronger communities; improving the relationship with aboriginal peoples; and advancing Canada's place in the world. It is large order. It is an ambitious agenda, but it is something that we simply have to do on behalf of all Canadians. Our plan for the next two to five years is comprehensive: first, increase maternity and parental leave benefits; second, a federal provincial agreement on more supports for early childhood development, which is very important; third, more after tax money in the hands of families; fourth, more family friendly workplaces; fifth, modernization of family law; sixth, a third significant investment in the national child benefit; and seventh, strengthened learning opportunities through an expanded SchoolNet. That is real support for Canadian families in the Canadian way. While hon. members opposite profess to offer so-called solutions to the country's woes, the government has delivered and is preparing to deliver even more. I think Canadians recognize this. The phone calls and letters I receive these days are much more optimistic and much more positive about our future than the ones I received 10 or 11 years ago. I want to be very frank. This is not to say that all is well and that the government can afford to rest on its laurels. That is not the truth. There are all kinds of things to do to keep on building this great country. There is a lot to be done. For example, in my home area of Canada in the west, prairie farmers find themselves in the midst of one of the worst agricultural periods since the Great Depression. The Liberal government has responded with a $1.5 billion income assistance program designed and implemented in partnership with the provinces and stakeholders. Many argue that $1.5 billion is not enough. It would be more accurate to say that not enough of it has been paid out so far. Federal assistance to prairie farmers has recently been boosted by an additional $170 million, something announced by the agriculture minister just days ago, raising the total federal emergency aid to farmers to over a billion dollars. This is over and above ongoing federal support payments of $600 million to agriculture. Having grown up on a farm in southern Manitoba around the community of Glenboro, I understand and greatly sympathize with the plight of prairie farmers. I would like to see existing income assistance moneys paid out as soon as possible. This is only part of the solution. In the Speech from the Throne the government reaffirmed its long term commitment to Canada's farmers. We will work to reduce foreign export subsidies at the upcoming WTO meetings in Seattle. The government also reaffirmed the importance of biotechnology research to the future of Canada's agriculture industry and pledged additional support. In addition, the government is committed to helping prairie farmers by building on the work already done by Judge Estey and Mr. Kroeger in their reports on the grain transportation system. The government must ensure that there is greater competition within the system and that producers receive the benefits through lower transportation costs. I will comment briefly on the importance of ongoing communication between the government and the public. I recently had the honour of heading up a caucus task force on the four western provinces. That task force was mandated to complement the work of the existing western Liberal caucus by consulting with western Canadians about what the government's priorities should be as we approach the new millennium. Without prejudicing the contents of the report, which I expect will be released very soon, western Canadians overwhelmingly welcomed the opportunity to be consulted on what the government's priorities should be as we enter the new millennium. The throne speech reflects many of the comments that my task force heard during our consultations. The commitment to further tax cuts while reinvesting in the social safety net, the commitment to further investments in research and development and improvements to our infrastructure, and ensuring that Canada's children and families are a priority are all important issues for western Canadians. The government is listening to western Canadians, indeed to all Canadians, and it is responding to what it is hearing. The throne speech provides an inspiring vision to take Canada into the new millennium.

I would be very interested and curious in seeing the document he presented to the House because it flies in the face of information that I have received. I am pleased to speak on Bill C-53, the small business loans bill. At the outset I would like to say that we in this party have been very much in favour of trying to find innovative ways in which small businesses can become more aggressive in trying to meet the challenges in their need to acquire capital in order to grow and become competitive. While we agree with the notion of this bill and its intent, we have a difficult time with parts of it. The auditor general supports our contention that there needs to be more accountability in the system to ensure that the moneys go to businesses and that there is a mechanism of determining that the money actually goes to the businesses that need it. We must also ensure that those moneys are repaid, that they come back to the taxpayers. We found that the moneys are being disbursed to companies that would by and large already receive bank loans. In effect this bill has been subsidizing the banks. The banks do not need subsidization. They are making some pretty fat profits and have been doing so for some time in spite of the recent downturn the entire economy is facing. On the larger issue, our legislative agenda for the next few months is about as useful as pabulum. Look at the situation in our country today. The really big issues are a plunging loonie, an economy that is in the doldrums and an international crisis the proportions of which we have not seen since the Great Depression. Our health care system is collapsing. The CPP is in dire straits. And we see issues for the House to spend time debating that have very little meaning to those grand problems that affect Canadians. We need to get back to dealing with the large issues. We need to use this House in a way that we can find the best solutions from within Canada and around the world and apply them to the problems at hand. The health care system is eroding. Canadians are in pain and are on enormously long waiting lists. The future of the CPP is in crisis. Our economy is falling apart. And we are looking at small, minuscule issues dealing with these problems if we deal with them at all. Let us get down to brass tacks. Let us get down to the real issues at hand. An important issue that Bill C-53 deals with is the economy. We have seen the lowering dollar. There has been a consecutive decline in the the GDP over the last four months. We have an unemployment rate which is 4% higher than that of the United States. Our productivity has declined. Our productivity was significantly lower than that of the U.S. when our dollar was 90 cents. It is still low at 65 cents. The public may or may not be aware of this, but our dollar is declining for many reasons. Some people point fingers at the Asian flu. Some people point fingers at the Russian meltdown. The bottom line is when we point a finger at something, three fingers point back at us. It is true that some of these things are out of our control but many are within our control. There are many constructive suggestions that we can employ. The Reform Party challenges the government to employ some of these solutions. How can we get our productivity up? The Canadian Federation of Independent Business put out a document three days ago. It articulately and eloquently shows that youth want to work but they are unable to work for many reasons. One of the biggest reasons they are unable to work are our high taxes. The government needs to reduce taxes. There are some specific solutions that my colleagues have spoken about. We spoke about reducing EI premiums. Let us also reduce the CPP premiums. This is a provincial responsibility, but let us also look at reducing workmen's compensation premiums which also contribute to choking off the private sector. Let us also remove the existing surtaxes that crush the private sector. There are surtaxes such as the capital gains tax. It impedes the private sector's ability to take moneys it has invested, sell things such as real estate and reinvest that money into the business. The capital gains tax restricts the movement of capital within our system thereby reducing our productivity. The government should work with the provinces to decrease those taxes. I challenge the finance minister to bring together his provincial counterparts within the next two weeks to discuss these issues, make a plan and institute it as soon as possible. By doing this we can make ourselves more competitive, not by reducing the loonie but by dealing with the structural reasons of why our country is non-productive. If we look at the history of the United States, the 1920s, the 1960s under President Kennedy, and the 1980s, every time there was a reduction in taxes there was a huge increase in the effectiveness of the economy. Why? There are increased savings and increased investment. There is also a greater desire to work because we know that the more we work, we will not have more money taken away from us. We will also see a reduction in the black market, a significant problem in our country. By reducing these tax loads we will be able to reduce the black market. In 1992 under Prime Minister Mulroney we found that more moneys came into the public coffers for the reasons I previously mentioned. We can deal with facts. Looking back in history we can see the constructive solutions that have already worked we and can apply them in 1998 to make them work for the people of our country today. I caution that this will not compromise the people who are most impoverished. It will make them more employable and will allow them to have more funds. It will rescue our social programs by making more funds available. Reducing taxes will allow us to deal with another important structural problem, the brain drain which my colleague spoke about earlier. In 1997 we lost 46,500 of our best and brightest people to the United States alone. Compare that with 1990 when we lost 20,500. That is a substantial difference. There has been a substantial change. Our best and brightest, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of our country are going south, not necessarily because they want to live there but because they see far greater opportunities there. Comparing the tax structures, after tax a family of two in the U.S. makes 44% more than a family of two wage earners in Canada. How can we compete with that? We cannot. Earlier this year the business community combined with the educational community to provide a number of constructive solutions to deal with another factor that could improve our economy, the educational system. It involved innovative partnerships between the private sector and the educational system that would do much to address one of the core pillars of a strong, nimble and effective economy. In a nutshell, the business round table had many recommendations. It recommended that all students learn at significantly higher levels and that the curriculum content reflects the higher expectations we would have of students. It recommended that instructional strategies and school choices vary to ensure success for all and that the system be based on performance by using a broad range of assessment tools. It recommended that schools have a major role in decision making, which would alleviate the rigid control over schools in what they can do. Schools should receive rewards for success, assistance to improve and penalties for failure to be effective teachers of today's youth. A major emphasis should be placed on staff development. The round table also recommended that employee unions at individual schools be required to grant waivers on certain contract provisions governing the hiring and firing of teachers and principals and on the participation of staff in academic and financial planning. I cannot overemphasize the importance of those recommendations. If we are going to have an effective, nimble and aggressive economy, we have to change our educational system. We have to give schools some control over what they do in terms of teaching. They must have control over their budgets. They also must have the ability to be assessed. Teachers federations have traditionally been completely opposed to an assessment of a teacher's performance. I feel this is wrong. Good teachers will benefit from the system because they will not only be keeping their jobs but they will also be rewarded for doing a good job. It would add the needed element of incentive into the teaching profession. It would remove from the system teachers who are not doing a good job. In any system, including this one, those who are not doing a good job get turfed. That may sound ruthless but when we are dealing with the future of our youth, we must give them the best opportunities we can. We owe it to the youth of today to ensure they have an opportunity for the best education possible. We must strive not only to help those who are among the most underprivileged and disadvantaged. We must also encourage those who are the best in our system and give them the challenges they require to become individuals who can contribute greatly to our society. The finance minister could do a couple of other innovative things. There is presently a limit on the amount Canadians can devote to foreign investment. It is now at 20%. The government should increase that to 30%. That would go a long way to enabling people to provide for their future. As we in the House all know, the CPP will not be there for those in my age group and younger as it has been for previous generations. The finance minister could actually expand RRSPs, have a designated RRSP amount. Those moneys could then be used to invest in the private sector, in small to medium size businesses on Canadian soil. If the finance minister were able to expand RRSPs, it would not be a lodestone around the taxpayer neck. It would also enable Canadians to invest in Canadian companies on Canadian soil and create Canadian jobs. It would be an important tool for increasing investment and innovation in the private sector by using the dollars that already exist. It would not rely on taxpayers. This is an important facet the prime minister and the finance minister should look at to enable us to put money into the private sector and to enable the private sector to do research and development. I would be remiss in suggesting that we not ensure the research and development system including the National Research Council have the moneys to do the very good research it does. It should be encouraged to partner with the private sector so that it will have the moneys to build another pillar of the private sector, the research and development section. Therein we would have a much more productive and effective economy for the future.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19971010-650.7.1.13", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Jake Hoeppner", "party": "Reform", "date": "1997-10-10", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, your father must be very proud of you in your elevation to the Chair. I congratulate you and wish you well. I will take a different slant on this issue. I will try to point out why some of these ports are probably not profitable and why we need more cost effective transportation or handling of these ports. My hon. colleague from Souris\u2014Moose Mountain gave me some stats from the Canadian Grain Commission. They really tell the story of what has happened to many of the ports. The dates for all of these ports range from 1987 to 1996. The Atlantic coast ports decreased from 552,000 tonnes in 1987 to 73,000 tonnes today. That is quite a decrease. The ports along the St. Lawrence have had an even bigger decrease. In 1987 they handled 11.8 million tonnes of grain. Today they are only handling about 4.4 million tonnes. We can see that the flow of traffic as far as grain is concerned has been diverted to some other transportation systems. Thunder Bay has done a little better. It has actually increased from 1.1 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes, possibly because of the grain going to the U.S. being loaded in Thunder Bay and then unloaded at Duluth. Churchill, which my hon. colleague from Dauphin\u2014Swan River talked about, used to handle about half a million tonnes or better of grain in 1987. In 1996 they were down to 227,000 tonnes. As we heard today that has increased to about 400,000 tonnes, which is a good trend for Churchill. The Pacific coast has actually stayed very stable at from 60 million tonnes in 1987 down to 40 million tonnes in 1996. Because of market trends in shipping products to Asia, west coast ports have done better than east coast ports. Why is that? One of the big reasons is that the costs at some of these ports have become almost unbearable for the shippers, especially grain farmers. In 1990 the St. Lawrence Pilotage Authority negotiated a new wage contract that gave a 32% increase in wages over three years, which was unheard of in those days for other industries. Why these people were able to leverage this kind of a contract I have no idea. In a nine month period pilots earn from $115,000 to $156,000. We were told during the hearings in Thunder Bay that they did not want to prove or disprove after nine months of operation that they still qualified for unemployment insurance. Their yearly earnings were fairly well looked after. This brought to light other things. I am looking at some of my notes. Mr. Kennedy, one of the town fathers of Thunder Bay, pointed out that the cost of a tonne of grain going down the St. Lawrence Seaway on a 20,000 tonne freighter would be $2.50 per tonne just for the pilotage. That is more money to be paid by farmers than all the fuel taxes on a tonne of grain being shipped across the country. We can see the additional costs. For a laker coming up stream with another type of freight it would be about $1.25 a tonne or about half. It is still very high and adds to the cost of operating the port. He also pointed out that a 10 day trip from Montreal up through the Great Lakes to Thunder Bay and back would cost shippers $53,000 just for the pilot. That is as much as the total wage bill for the crew of the ship. We can see that something is wrong in the pilotage authority that should be addressed in the bill. In 1995 we were led to believe that this was one of the most important issues and that it would be dealt with when the marine bill was brought forward. However it has been deleted and that really bothers me. People will have to begin realizing that if grain transportation costs are not brought down there will not be much grain going through some of the ports. The sooner we recognize that, the better off we will be. When I looked at some of the figures that the grain companies gave us, it was astounding what property taxes were doing to some of these ports and terminals. Cargill has a terminal in Duluth which is a third bigger than its terminal at Thunder Bay. It was paying $27,000 property taxes at Duluth and $1.25 million at Thunder Bay. It is about the same for west coast ports. They are somewhat lower but the property taxes on some grain facilities are unbelievable. That will have to be addressed, or we will begin to see things happen such as what is taking place in rail transportation now. Going back to figures the hon. member for Souris\u2014Moose Mountain gave me, direct shipping to the U.S. by rail in 1987 was 60,000 tonnes. In 1996 it was 1.889 million tonnes. We see that these ports are interfering with the shipment of grain, in which direction it should go, because of the costs. The Canadian Wheat Board, one of my favourite friends, tried a number of projects to ship grain down the Mississippi. It was quite successful. It would take grain up to Minneapolis, barge it down the Mississippi and export it. Those things are happening. The government will have to realize it better do something to address the costs of ports or they will totally lose the business. Once the business is gone it is pretty hard to bring it back, except it can be attracted with lower costs that are feasible and reasonable. I was astounded by what the pilotage did to shipping on the Great Lakes. A Canadian ship owner who testified before the hearings had five vessels in the seaway system. In 1994 he estimates he could have saved $475,000 on pilotage costs if they were in a competitive environment and operated on commercial rates. That was half a million dollars for four ships. When 10 or 12 million tonnes of grain are taken through the system, we can be seen how it affects shippers. Why is the Government of Canada allowing these things to happen? As the whole transportation system was developing there was so much government interference in the system that they do not know how to rectify it. It is so far out of whack compared to the U.S. system. While freight costs are a little higher as far as rail is concerned in the U.S, if I ship a load of grain through the handling system from my farm in Snowflake, Manitoba, to Seattle, I can save $16 a tonne just by elevation and handling charges in the grain handling system. These are items that we have to address. I have a little story to finish up the whole debate. In the 1930s during the Bennett buggy days car tops were taken off, shafts were put on the wheels and cars were pulled by horse. In those days one of my neighbours who was shipping a carload of barley to Thunder Bay got a bill for a number of dollars and the price of the barley did not cover the freight. The station master sent him a bill. He went to the station master and said \u201cSir, I haven't got any money. I can't pay this freight bill. The barley didn't cover the cost of it, so you are just out of it\u201d. Things being very tough in those days, the station master said \u201cBring me a rooster and we will call it even-steven\u201d. About a week later the farmer came back to town and brought two roosters with him. The station agent said \u201cSir, I only asked for one rooster. Why would you bring me two?\u201d He said \u201cWell, sir, you have forgotten I have another carload of barley to ship\u201d. That is about the way we are running our transportation system today. It is becoming so costly that shippers cannot survive with it. Sooner or later it will die. If we have to pay it in roosters, the chicken industry in Ontario will also fold.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19940209-1028.5.1.40", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Paul Cr\u00eate", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "1994-02-09", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Very, very simple indeed. The standard of equalization is the per capita revenues resulting from the application of the representative tax system in five provinces, namely Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Quebec and Manitoba. In 1993-94, the standard was $4,731. Together with equalization come floor or minimum payment level provisions protecting each recipient against a sudden annual drop in equalization payments. Bill C-3 would renew the equalization program for another five years, from April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1999. The maximum payment level would be maintained at the 1992-93 level. Note that the Department of Finance plans to maintain this ceiling for the five years covered by the bill. This will limit the growth of the payments made to the provinces. The Department of Finance also planning statutory changes to the tax bases used in the equalization formula. The complexity of the process hints at its inefficiency. Bill C-3, An Act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act, can be considered from various angles. First, one could wonder about the actual impact of the goals of this piece of legislation. Let us not forget that equalization was established to compensate a major shortcoming in the Canadian federal system, in which the federal government has the power to spend tax revenues without authority over provincial areas of jurisdiction. Equalization was instituted in the federal system based on the proceedings of the Rowell-Sirois commission. Since then, equalization has prevented Canada from breaking up, but it has created negative effects of its own which, among other things, have contributed to the loss of faith of the people in the tax system governing them. Not being able to establish a direct link between the government levying taxes and the one providing services makes it difficult for the Quebec and Canadian taxpayers to assess fully how each level of government is carrying out its responsibilities. The main negative effect however has certainly been the introduction of a ceiling on the amount that can be paid to a so-called have not province. This ceiling thwarts the initial goal of equalization by widening the gap. Quebec will have to assume 60 per cent of the cut imposed on recipient provinces, solely because of this ceiling. Let us recall the basic objectives set by Quebec's finance minister as the basis for provincial transfer reform, in order to adjust to the financial and budget realities of the 1990s. These basic objectives are: to better balance government responsibilities against tax revenue; to improve the redistribution of wealth in Canada; and to enhance Canadian public sector efficiency. Mr. Bourbeau, Quebec's finance minister, is known as a passionate federalist. But he went on to say: \"I nevertheless find it difficult to accept that the federal government has decided to maintain the ceiling provision of the equalization program\". The finance minister of Quebec and his critic in the National Assembly agree on this. Poorer provinces will, paradoxically, help to trim the federal deficit. I think this provides compelling evidence that the federal system does not work. Only an extensive reform of the overall transfer program structure can correct the present situation. This reform should be based on the following elements: no cuts in real terms and per capita to provincial transfer payments; no national standards incompatible with Quebec's specific situation; non-interference by the federal government in areas of provincial jurisdiction, which is a well-known cause of inefficiency. This reform must be aimed at a better redistribution of revenue among the provinces, particularly in terms of equalization payments. The equalization ceiling must be removed. This bill clearly shows that Canada's Liberal government paid no attention whatsoever to the message delivered by the people of Quebec, who elected 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois. Quebecers no longer want to be dependent on a system that encourages them to stay poor. The current system is an incentive to inefficiency. In spite of all this, the federal government has decided to deal with equalization as if it were business as usual. If I were a member of the majority defending Canadian federalism, I would oppose maintaining the ceiling provision of the equalization program for the sake of equity within the Canadian federation. Unfortunately I did not hear many members opposite say the same thing. But, as a member of Quebec's national community that has pursued self-sufficiency for 50 years, I know that maturity entails specific responsibilities and powers that will allow people to determine their government's effectiveness. Nevertheless, the removal of the ceiling is a cure the current system cannot do without. To determine if the equalization system meets its objectives, we should check if it has corrected economic, social and cultural inequalities among the various parts of Canada since its implementation. Unfortunately, that is not the case. If you compare unemployment rates, the exodus of young people from various regions of Quebec in the last 20 to 30 years, the system is a failure as all indicators clearly show. Furthermore, the imposition of a ceiling does not meet the objectives of the equalization program. This program makes it difficult for taxpayers to assess its effectiveness. That is one of the main reasons why voters distrust politicians like us as well as the process itself because Canadians cannot tell if the money they invest in taxes comes back to them in the form of adequate services. The people we pay our taxes to are not necessarily those who deliver services and I think this is an important shortcoming that should be addressed. Taxes are collected by the federal government. The federal government then transfers the money to the provinces who, in turn, distribute it among their various programs, while the poor taxpayer must determine the effectiveness of this and that and find out what is going on. All this to say that, by tabling Bill C-3, the government has demonstrated that it has set aside the real changes expected by Canadians. While waiting for a comprehensive reform package we are asking it to at least remove the ceiling.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19940210-1029.9.1.56", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "government", "speaker": "Ronald J.

This is a noble and essential objective. But why is the Bloc asking for such a committee? It is something we should look at. Of course, like us and like members of other parties, they want to know if it is possible to spend better or less. It is a very good thing and I share this feeling. I want to do it and I think we all agree that it must be done. We heard today an interesting comment from a member of the Reform Party. There are still a few differences between the Bloc and Reform. It is sometimes difficult to see these differences but I think there is at least one. This member from the Reform Party indicated that, in his opinion, the Bloc was trying to open a constitutional debate. Why would the Bloc want to open a constitutional debate? If we analyze this comment carefully, could it be to promote their goal, namely separation from Canada? I hope I am mistaken. I do not want to accuse them, but I should remind Bloc members that this comment was made today by a Reform member. If there are any doubts as to the validity of my interpretation, one only has to check Hansard . It is one possibility, but I think that the Bloc may want to move in a different direction. Every now and then, they remember that they are the Official Opposition so it is only natural that they want to embarrass the government. It is only natural that they try to create a situation suggesting that the current system of government, namely federalism, is not working. Why is it that I make those particular points? The Bloc knows very well that there is a committee which exists right now. There is a committee which exists right now that can attain all of the objectives that are in the opposition motion. The Bloc chairs that committee. It has the key position on the committee. If there is a mechanism that exists to achieve the objectives that have been enunciated here on paper then are there other objectives that it is trying to pursue? Why is it asking to create something that already exists essentially to do those things it says it wants to do and that we all want to do, and that is to see whether we can spend better and more wisely fewer public funds? As we examine this question I would hope that we would ask ourselves some very serious questions. We talk about concepts such as overlap and duplication as if they were the same thing. When I raised a question today of a member of the Reform Party, whether the member made a distinction, the member sloughed it off, I cannot say the party did, as simply being interested in saving money. Let me assure the members that we are interested in saving money as well. It seems to me that before we go forward we have to have a clear sense of what it is we are trying to accomplish. Do we want to attack duplication only which to my way of thinking is another program that is essentially the same? Do we want to simply look at overlap? Do we know the difference between overlap and duplication? Overlap is where there are similarities but not necessarily a total similarity and a total duplication. We are just sloughing that off. There may be a necessity for overlap in some situations. It is my view that the more we can eliminate overlap and duplication the better off we are. Let me give an example. In the whole question of environment there are certain provinces that abut territories. There are questions of environment that flow from the federal government to the territory as well as to the province. There may even be a need for duplication. Let me give but one example. We have schools, generally speaking that are administered by school boards. In certain instances we need schools that are administered by the federal government for our aboriginal people. That is changing and it is going in the right direction. To simply say we want to get rid of all overlap, all duplication without knowing the distinctions between overlap and duplication, without considering whether there are some needs for overlap and duplication, is not doing this particular activity justice. Everybody would agree that there is overlap and duplication between the federal and provincial governments that needs to be looked at in a very serious way. What I am surprised at as well is that we have not talked about another level of government. Is there a need to examine whether there is too much overlap and duplication among the various levels of government, federal, provincial and municipal? There is in many instances. Let us remember that if we are allowing ourselves to look at overlap and duplication between federal and provincial levels we ought to be able to extend that to municipal levels because municipal structures, governmental structures, are created by provincial governments. What about overlap itself within certain levels of government, within, for example, the federal government, within provincial governments, within municipal governments? Let me give a good example of overlap within federal governments. I am told that during the last government there were programs related to education, training, retraining; education broadly defined, if you wish, to be found in over a dozen federal departments. Is that necessary? Is that good for the nation? Can we have a focus with that kind of spread, that kind of non-co-ordination. I think not. In my own province of Manitoba a very serious duplication exists between the provincial and municipal authorities. It is social assistance. In some cases people receive social assistance from the provincial authorities. In other cases it is from the municipal authorities. Sometimes it is very difficult to follow why one gets it from one level of government or the other level of government. There are differences in programs. There are administrators in both and one could logically ask whether that should continue to exist. Let me broach another topic. I do not think we have looked at the public accounts committee in a serious way. It can review spending. If it can review spending, clearly it can ask questions about overlap and duplication. Why would we not use this committee? In a sense there is a contradiction there. Since we already have a committee, why should we set up another one? The existing committee can reach the same objectives as those mentioned in Official Opposition's motion before us today. It seems to me there is a glaring contradiction. We want to attack overlap and duplication and yet we are prepared to undertake an act that will cause overlap and duplication. It doest not make any sense at all. There are many studies that point out that there is a problem in this area. The House has heard reference to the 1937 Rowell-Sirois commission, the 1978 study of the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration publique, of the 1978-79 federal provincial duplication of services review, of the 1984-85 task force on program review, of the regulatory reform initiative, of the 1991 Treasury Board secretariat study on federal-provincial overlap and duplication. The House will perhaps be happy to note something that falls in line with the debate today. In this most recent study, in all studies, there were activities of overlap in many areas and duplication in a number of areas. Overlap in federal and provincial programs took several forms. In general, governments were managing some of these overlaps and duplications in an effective way. However, they all admitted that there is considerable scope for improving program delivery through better co-ordination or harmonization. Let me review the motion to make sure that we are talking about the same thing. The motion before us today reads as follows: That this House urge the Government to strike a Special Committee of the House, composed of representatives of all the official parties, with a mandate to examine public expenditures by the federal government, in light of the Report of the Auditor General of Canada, concerning overlap between federal and provincial government programs and in accordance with the following guidelines: (1) the Committee's deliberations would be an open and transparent process allowing for the public examination of official matters; This is not possible. (2) the Committee would have the power to subpoena any witnesses whose testimony would be considered helpful; This is possible. (3) the Committee would be required to report to the House by June 23, 1994; I believe that the date is different but surely accommodations could be made if this is important. I see no reason to create an additional committee but I see reason to pursue the objective of examining where we could spend less and yet serve all citizens in a meaningful way. There is a committee to do it and I would urge that it be done. Let us do it. I think we should all work together to cut government expenditures at all levels and to create jobs for all Canadians.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19960418-1319.3.2.28", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Jan Brown", "party": "Reform", "date": "1996-04-18", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to the amended motion. I have looked forward to this opportunity for some time because what we are looking at is the last piece of enabling legislation for the House to consider. Certainly after two years and some months of being in the House, it could not be more timely. Also of interest, it is the last piece of legislation to implement what I call the Kim Campbell cabinet. I oppose the bill for a number of reasons and I will list them. It gives to the federal government powers to circumvent the provinces when establishing programs and initiatives through HRD. I oppose the cheap partisan reason for the creation of the ministry of labour and I oppose the way the government is attempting to hide information from Canadians by eliminating the provision to create an annual report for the department. I will spend some time speaking to the specifics. As I mentioned, my colleagues and I have legitimate and valid concerns about the legislation. In particular, there is an area of the bill which we believe provides the federal government with new powers to enter into agreements with agencies, groups or agents and allows the federal government to entertain these co-operative agreements without first having approached the provincial governments.

We believe that simply put the bill gives the government the opportunity to circumvent the provinces when delivering social programs or any of the services relevant to the Department of Human Resources Development. This kind of federal power grab runs contrary to the contemporary federal trend toward decentralization. We have spent many hours in the House in debate and in question period discussing that very point. Remember that the Liberal government promised Canadians during the Quebec referendum campaign that among other things it would move to greater decentralization. There has been zero movement on this front. In this bill there is a marvellous example of a federal attempt to nationalize powers that did not exist before. This is a very old approach to government. This is the Trudeau approach. It is an approach which began just after the second world war, one which does not suit the needs of people in Canada today. First year students in Canadian politics learn that Canada has a rigid constitution. It is rigid in the sense that constitutional amendments are not easily made. As is well known, it was extremely difficult to amend the British North America Act. We need not remind anyone that amending the Constitution has not been made any easier by the Canadian Constitution Act, as events since 1982 have so clearly demonstrated. Amending procedures were not spelled out in the BNA. The result is that we had precious few constitutional amendments between 1867 and 1982. It will also be recalled that the BNA sought to establish a highly centralized union but that various judicial interpretations made it a more decentralized union. In addition, the Fathers of Confederation felt that in turning over responsibility for education, health and social welfare to the provinces they were dealing with jurisdictions that were not important and local in character. It also explains why Ottawa's power of taxation far exceeds its constitutional responsibilities. The Fathers of Confederation gave the federal government power to raise moneys by \"any mode or system of taxation\". It is important to bear in mind the role of government in 1867 was highly limited. The Rowell-Sirois commission pointed out: \"The principal functions of the state followed the prescriptions of Adam Smith. Government was thought to have met its purpose when it provided for adequate defence, the enforcement of the general law for the administration of justice and the maintenance of a few essential public works\". In addition, Canadian society in 1867 was still largely a pioneer in rural society. Accordingly, it had clearly an individualistic outlook and a reliance on the family as the unit of mutual welfare. The Great Depression would change all of that. Franklin D. Roosevelt's new deal would lead the way for governments in western industrialized countries to intervene to soften the sting of economic misfortune. Lord Keynes, a noted Cambridge economist, was quick to provide the intellectual underpinnings for government intervention in the economy to mitigate the lows in economic cycles. In brief, Keynesian logic provided a basis for counter-cyclical budgeting. It also provided a basis for government programs and measures to stabilize the economy, to promote economic development and full employment. It suggested that with latent demand and no limit in factors of production, governments could actually create the long sought after prosperous and rational societies desired. Keynesian economics also legitimized government deficits and in time governments would spend more, tax more and borrow more, a great deal more. Does this not sound an awful lot like the fiscal policies of today's Liberal government? It is this Keynesianism gone wild that causes the Minister of Human Resources Development and his bureaucrats to propose clauses like the ones in this bill that instead of allowing the provinces to manage their own affairs, allows the federal government to grab more power. The Keynesian revolution captured the Department of Finance in Canada as it did the treasuries of other western countries. Canadians emerged from the second world war determined never to permit another depression of the kind witnessed in the 1930s. In addition, by war's end, Canadians held a strong belief in the ability of government to intervene and manage the economy. Canadians had learned during the war that governments were able in moments of crisis and when moved by an all consuming goal to lead the country to high levels of economic activity and employment. Not only did the allies win the war, but governments had managed the war economy well. Unemployment had fallen to zero, yet prices had been held down. Given this, no one was surprised when the Government of Canada presented a major policy paper to Parliament toward the end of the war which was Keynesian in outlook. It said: \"The government will be prepared in periods where unemployment threatens to incur deficits and increases in the national debt resulting from its employment and income policy. In periods of buoyant employment and income, budget plans will call for surpluses\". However the expected severe post-war economic downturn did not materialize and the measure that the federal government had prepared proved unnecessary. Still, Ottawa became convinced that it possessed a new arsenal of economic policy to achieve high unemployment and more generally to manage the national economy. At the risk of stating the obvious, Keynesian economics looks to the national economy and to promoting balance in economic cycles when formulating policy prescriptions and to the national government as the key economic factor. The important point here is that Keynesian economics has a strong centralization bias. It looks to national fiscal policies, national industrial strategies and to national programs to develop the national economy. In short, Roosevelt and Keynesian economics would turn national governments loose on national economies. Convinced that it had found the holy grail of economic policy, it had only to look to what other more western industrialized countries were doing to confirm their findings. Ottawa nevertheless recognized that it did not have the necessary jurisdictions to manage the national economy and to promote the positive state. The findings of the Rowell-Sirois royal commission had told it as much when it began to table its findings in 1940. Ottawa also was all too well aware that given the inherent rigidity of the written Constitution, it could not count on constitutional amendments to give life to the welfare state. In addition, in the rare instances when it was able to secure a constitutional amendment, it only served to create shared jurisdictions. For example, the 1951 amendment to the BNA which gave Ottawa authority to establish the old age security program made pensions a matter of shared federal-provincial jurisdiction. I will not even begin to comment on old age security, which we know as OAS, because as we all know the Liberals ostensibly killed it despite their campaign promises to the contrary. This bill allows the government to grab more powers in keeping with the Keynesian principles I have already explained within a historical context. The rigidity of the Constitution led the federal government to find ways to circumvent its provisions and to develop new mechanisms to implement a new economic order. The federal government would identify for itself a role in many areas of provincial responsibility through extensive use of its spending power. In time a whole edifice of federal-provincial programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction was put in place although such programs remain unmentioned in our written Constitution. The clauses in this bill with which we are concerned will provide the federal government the opportunity to create joint programs with municipalities. This constitutional breach has been circumvented. Ironically municipalities are not even constitutionally recognized entities. These are big questions to ask and to answer. The written Constitution in the end appears to matter little to federal policy makers. Ottawa in the post-war period attracted some of the best and the brightest determined to build a modern, positive state. Fuelled by tax money from a rapidly expanding post-war economy and convinced that only the federal government could put into practice the lessons learned from Keynesian economics, Ottawa promoted a new constitutional doctrine which ignored the written Constitution. Donald Smiley, one of Canada's leading constitutional scholars, explained: \"According to the constitutional doctrine that came to prevail, the central government might legally spend revenues as it chose, even on matters within the jurisdiction of the provinces, and could at its discretion fix the circumstances under which a potential recipient might receive the federal largesse\". Bill C-11 allows the federal government to enter into agreements now with agencies and municipalities. The reason for this is so the federal government can continue to dole out that largesse and take credit for it. It is simple to understand. The federal government is reducing transfers to the provinces and as a result it is losing its clout, its ability to dictate how the money is spent. Therefore, it is losing its ability to buy votes by proclaiming how it is giving out the dole at the provincial level. However, the Liberal need to buy votes through empty rhetoric and equally empty promises remains just as strong today as it ever was. In order to be able to buy those votes the federal government is now compelled to deal directly with agencies and municipalities. The federal government did not wait long after World War II to introduce measures in the areas of health care and social policy. Within 20 years it would put in place a wide array of federal-provincial measures ranging from old age pensions to the establishment of a national health care program. In time the federal government would introduce its own programs and carve out for itself a powerful role and presence in virtually every sector in the economy. When it opted for conditional grants it essentially intervened in provincial fields on its own terms. In the end it was able to carve out a role for itself in the provision of welfare assistance, in assisting the unemployed, in post-secondary education, in medicare, in energy, in industrial development, in economic development and so on. The desire and ability of the federal government to intervene in areas of provincial jurisdiction did not wane in the 1970s. In the early 1970s the federal Department of Regional Economic Expansion introduced a new approach to economic development. In doing so, Ottawa signed a series of general development agreements, known as GDAs, with the provinces. The GDAs were enabling documents in that they cleared the way for the federal government to support whatever measures were regarded appropriate to local, provincial and regional economic circumstances. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the GDA approach essentially tossed aside our written Constitution to enable government to support whatever it felt was necessary to promote economic development. A cursory look at the activities sponsored by the GDAs and their replacement agreements reveal an incredible array of measures and initiatives. No economic sector was considered off limits. One corollary of this blurring of the constitutional lines is to confuse not just at the government level but more important at the level of the citizenry exactly which level of government is responsible for which service. The clauses in this bill which give new and greater powers to the provinces do nothing to redirect the constitutional blurring of the jurisdictional lines. In fact it only contributes to more blurring as now we can add another layer of government to the confusion. As well, it has also given rise to overlap and duplication in government programs and to a costly government overhead. Try counting the number of units in the federal government sporting the labels of liaison, co-ordination, federal-provincial relations and intergovernmental relations, to describe what they do. Now we will have to add yet another level to this red tape insanity. Countless meetings are held every month to administer federal-provincial programs and agreements. We should bear in mind that Ottawa spends over $20 billion a year to pay federal public servants and to provide them with office space and other administrative arrangements. I can only imagine just how much more money this bill will end up costing Canadian taxpayers as it adds another layer to that already overburdened bureaucracy. My colleague from Mission-Coquitlam moved an amendment to redress the offending clauses to which I have been referring. She moved an amendment that before the federal government enters directly into agreements with agencies or municipalities of a province that it first consult with and receive the approval of the lieutenant governor of the province in question. The amendment was reasonable. It would still have allowed the federal government to enter into such agreements, even though of course we oppose them, but it would only have then required that the federal government inform the provinces of the actions about to be undertaken. However, the Liberals needed so badly to implement their vote buying clause that they refused to entertain this reasonable amendment. I used to think that we were here in the House to work together. However, cynical partisan moves like that cause me to be circumspect. They cause me to believe that the Liberals are not really here for the betterment of our country. They are really only here to maintain the status quo, to hold onto power at all costs, even if it means willingly and knowingly doing the wrong thing and implementing vote buying policies just as those in this bill. I have great concerns that Bill C-11 will go another step down the road to giving the federal government greater powers, despite what it says. Not only will it create overlap and duplication, it will probably cost us billions of dollars all for the sake of buying Liberal votes. Speaking of buying Liberal votes, that brings me to my second concern over this bill, which is the creation of the Ministry of Labour. This bill finally enables the last of the Kim Campbell cabinet departments. In 1993 when the Prime Minister named his cabinet he did not name a minister for labour. Not a single Liberal complained then that such a position was necessary. Why was that? Because the job can be accomplished within the Department of Human Resources Development. We do not need an expensive portfolio for an issue that can be covered by other ministers. For almost two years the Liberals agreed with us on this point. Why did they change their minds? What caused the epiphany? When the Liberals took power in 1993 they did not see a need for this individual or the assignment of this ministry. We did not hear a peep from anybody. However the Prime Minister changed his mind in February 1995. In order to entice the so-called star candidate from Quebec to run in a Quebec byelection, the Prime Minister promised her a new cabinet seat if she agreed to run. She agreed and they created the Ministry of Labour for her. Let us face facts. The Liberals only created the job to satisfy their partisan backroom interests. Their focus was not labour; it was about their own job creation formula to entice a so-called star candidate. During report stage on Bill C-11 we heard a lot of sanctimonious talk from the Liberals. They pretended to be the friends of labour. We know the truth, do we not? The Reform Party has nothing to learn from the federal Liberal Party when it comes to labour relations and how to treat people. Our policies clearly state that we recognize the right of workers to organize unions, to strike peacefully and to carry out the business of collective bargaining. The Liberals cancelled the federal public service workforce adjustment directive. I wonder how many Liberals campaigned on a promise to fire 45,000 public service workers. How many of them were honest enough to tell their constituents that as part of their job, job, job program they meant to fire 45,000 civil servants? I wonder how many of these Liberals campaigned on a promise to allow collective bargaining except, of course, when there is a strike in the port system. They were all very quick to force labour back to work, were they not? I wonder how many in the labour movement know that the Liberal Minister of Human Resources Development refuses to meet with the head of the Canadian Labour Congress. Over and over again in committee there have been complaints regarding this very action, or lack of action, on the part of the minister. This is what Liberals mean about being open to the concerns of Canadians. They refuse to even meet with labour leaders. Also how many on that side of the House campaigned for quota based employment equity legislation like the kind they rammed through the House? The Liberal record speaks for itself. When it comes to labour issues, this government should be ashamed. The Reform Party has clearly and honestly established its position regarding the existence of the job of Minister of Labour. Reform favours smaller, less expensive government that effectively provides services for Canadians where they cannot provide for themselves. To this end we believe that labour issues should be managed by the Department of Human Resources Development. As the Liberals first believed in 1993 there is no need for this position. The difference is that Reform is consistent on labour issues. Our Liberal colleagues appear not to be. They have flip-flopped all over the place on labour issues. My final disagreement with Bill C-11 pertains to the fact that the government is trying to hide from Canadians both its performance and its future plans. It is doing this by eliminating the requirement for the production of an annual report. Indeed, this is really quite alarming when it is taken at face value. Colleagues on the other side of the House will say that it is just because they are really trying to reduce costs but this is a matter of financial accountability and certainly in terms of performance standards in any corporate sector would be an obvious expectation from a board of directors. We had proposed an amendment that would require the Minister of Human Resources Development to table an annual report to the House. Typically the Liberals rejected this proposal. Anything that appears to promote open and honest government they oppose. Bill C-11 as presented does not require an annual report to be made from the department. I am concerned that this may be just another way for the government to withhold information from the House of Commons and the people of Canada. I believe it should be mandatory for all government departments to publish annual reports and for the purpose of accountability they should be placed before Parliament. As part of the new program review, the federal government is changing the production of the estimates. It suggests that in a few years it will make the estimates more user friendly, whatever that means, and that more useful and practical information will be included in the estimates. The government suggests that annual reports are so general that they border on being useless. Every bill that has been introduced to create a new department has had the annual report component deleted. The government has deleted the requirement for the production of departmental annual reports. Our amendment would have required the government to continue producing that annual report component for each of those departments. We are sceptical of the process for improving the estimates. At minimum, until such improvements have been made, annual reports should be continued. Until the estimates are improved, the lack of annual reports will result in the Canadian public receiving less information from government. In effect the Liberals are trying to hide, at least it appears, information from Canadians about the workings of their government. We all know that the red book promises more open government. This is open government? No more annual reports is open government? I do not think so. Reform exists to change government. Liberals had an opportunity to demonstrate to Canadians that they were willing to open up government and to allow Canadians greater access to all information regarding how it operates. It should not be a secret. What is the government trying to hide? It had the chance to open itself up to greater public scrutiny and it chose to hide. It is taxpayer money that the Liberals are spending, my money and yours, Mr. Speaker. Canadians should know how and where their money is going. The government, by opposing our amendment, proved to Canadians that it does not give the appearance of caring about accountability or openness. I ask the question again: What is the government trying to hide? Is this just another way for the Liberals to address their dismal failure on the deficit fight? They will not make public or even produce an annual report for this department, one of the largest spenders in the government. This department is huge. Canadians, thanks to the Liberals, will not be able to keep track of its developments. The government says its estimates will be improved but it also said it would scrap the GST, and we know where we are at with that right now. Who are we to believe? Is this a case of what we do not know will not hurt us? Maybe that is why the government did not mention the debt in the budget speech. Ignore it and perhaps everyone else will too. The Liberals should talk about it. They should admit that they have been responsible for the growth of the debt since 1968 and honestly attack the debt problem. We are seeing no action. I insist that we need an annual report for this department. I believe with the inclusion of the amendments the Reform Party suggested, Bill C-11 would be a much better bill. The amendments would make the department more forward thinking in its approach to problems and certainly more accountable. If the Reform amendments had been approved and passed in the House we could have supported this bill. However, we have attempted to improve the bill and yet again the government has resisted. Given that the government has clearly made a substantial new power grab in this bill and given that it refused even to listen to Reform's reasoned compromise, we cannot support it.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19990215-867.9.1.43", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Diane Ablonczy", "party": "Reform", "date": "1999-02-15", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-65, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. Any time we hear the word fiscal it means money. When we talk about money we mean our money as Canadian taxpayers. Governments have no money of their own but they certainly make free with the money that we work to earn. This involves large amounts of the money earned by hard working Canadian taxpayers. That is the reason it is a very important debate. However, the government has decided to cut off debate on the spending of billions of dollars of taxpayers money under the bill. For some reason it feels that a mere day of debate is more than sufficient to explore the ins and outs of a very large expenditure of money. Naturally the opposition disagrees vehemently with this as well it should. The whole reason we are here is to enact laws and to administer the affairs of the country for the benefit of Canadians. It is very difficult to do that job when government keeps cutting off debate and saying that it will do whatever it will do. It does not really want to be confused with any facts or any suggestions for improving the course of action that it has already decided on. This topic not only is very important because it will be spending a great deal of money that we worked to earn. It is also at the very heart of our federal system. It involves the transfer of financial resources from the federal treasury, which is filled up by our taxes, to the provinces to allow them to deal with their responsibility to provide social programs and services to Canadians. These transfers not only include the equalization payments but also the payments to support health care, education, EI payments from the EI fund, regional grants and a host of smaller programs. The total transfers from the equalization component are close to $9 billion a year. With all the other transfers to support social programs it is at least three times that. We are talking about a very important element of the way our federation works. One of the best resources I have found is a booklet by Paul Boothe, Professor of Economics at the University of Alberta, called \u201cFinding A Balance: Renewing Canadian Fiscal Federalism\u201d. This was produced in October 1998, just a few months ago. It is very current and a very scholarly and lucid examination of the whole area of financial transfers within the federation. I commend it to anyone who is trying to understand this complex and difficult area. Equalization is an important principle which makes the federation work. It is a principle to which the official opposition, the Reform Party, is committed. I make this point clearly and unequivocally. Those who propose improved administration of equalization are often attacked\u2014and we saw that this afternoon in the House\u2014by those who lack the vision and courage to make needed improvements. It is because the principle of equalization is so vital to a vigorous Canadian federation that we in parliament must ensure co-operation in a fair and effective process. Equalization directly affects the security of important social programs such as health care and education. Equalization directly affects the level of income left in the hands of Canadians and Canadian parents and families to meet the needs of our children. Here is a little background on equalization. Before Confederation most of the provincial revenues came from customs and excise taxes. With Confederation it became the exclusive purview of the federal government to levy customs and excise taxes. Therefore the provinces did not have the money they needed to provide key services to their citizens that they were responsible to provide under the Constitution. Under an important recommendation from the Rowell-Sirois commission in 1939 it was agreed that the federal government would institute a system of national adjustment grants for poorer provinces and that general transfers would be made to ensure that the provinces had enough revenue to fulfil their constitutional obligations without undue taxation. These formal equalization payments began in 1957. As many speakers on this side of the House have put forward, the transfers in support of services to Canadians have become an increasingly complex patchwork impacted by a multitude of diverse political and economic purposes. The results, the transparency and the understandability of the whole area of the federation have become unnecessarily unfair and complex. Today, for example, the provinces have access to per capita revenues equal to the potential average of five provinces to raise taxes, and this is based on 33 different tax bases. With that simple explanation we see how complex this whole area has become. To make equalization work clearly and equitably every province would need the same kind of tax system, but of course that is not the case. They are all different. What the federal government has done, what the legislation does, is impose an artificial hypothetical tax system trying to blend tax systems in 10 different provinces on 33 different levels and obviously a real mess results. The auditor general has criticized the whole process. In his 1997 report he looked at only one of the 33 elements, property taxes which raises almost a quarter of the equalization payments. He pointed out that property tax rates vary from province to province. Property assessment methods vary even between municipalities, let alone provinces. Property assessments are infrequent and done in different years. The auditor general said that it was just a guessing game. In 1997 the finance department acknowledged this problem which was brought before it by the auditor general. It promised to do something about the problem. In fact here is a quote of a promise it made to the auditor general: The department expects to address this issue as part of the current equalization renewal process. Here we are smack dab in the middle of the \u201ccurrent equalization renewal process\u201d. Does the bill say anything about the matter of property taxes and their calculation and how they are factored into the equalization payment? No, it does not. Yet Liberal members opposite have the colossal nerve to stand in this place and say that this is a wonderful piece of legislation, that it is just ticking along fine. After a few hours of letting the opposition bleat about it, it will go forward exactly as they envisioned, even though they have not kept a key promise made to the auditor general. A number of such problems in the equalization process are not addressed in the legislation. My colleagues have been very eloquent in pointing out some of the anomalies and the ridiculous variations and variables in the way the whole program is delivered on behalf of Canadians. It is a key program. It is important to the proper working of our federation. I urge the House to examine the systemic changes, the changes to our equalization system, needed to deal realistically with the tax system and the difficulties that have been pointed out. Let us build a better country through reasoned debate on these issues rather than simply sweep them under the closure carpet and move on with mere tinkering.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19981124-833.4.12.1", "topic": "Oral Question Period", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Mark Muise", "party": "Progressive Conservative", "date": "1998-11-24", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, Canadian farmers across the country are struggling to survive in the grips of the most severe crisis to hit our farming communities since the Great Depression.

It is my pleasure to rise and address budget 2005. At the outset I want to note a glaring omission, especially considering it was coming from a finance minister who makes his home in Regina, Saskatchewan. I am talking about the fact that in the very long budget speech he did not even take note of the crisis on Canadian farms today; I see a friend of mine from the Regina area back here. Out on the farm today, it is a disaster. Farm incomes have been negative for a number of years. In 2003 we had negative farm incomes for the first time since the Great Depression. Today grain and oilseed prices are worse, if anything. They have fallen through the floor and of course we are still suffering with the mad cow crisis. There was no mention of this farm disaster in the budget. There was certainly no help. The only thing in there was a reference to the cash deposit that producers must make to the CAIS program. In fact, a few weeks ago we moved a motion in this place, and had it passed, it would have eliminated the cash deposit. That did find its way into the budget document. So again the Conservative Party is pushing the agenda on standing up for the Canadian farm. I am very disappointed that the finance minister, who is from Regina, did not even take note of the disaster on Canadian farms today. First and foremost, budget 2005 really was an admission that the Conservative Party was right. In the last election campaign, the Conservative Party campaigned on a platform of tax relief and of increases in spending for the Canadian military. The government told Canadians that if we went down that road it would hurt Canada. It said that would drive Canada into deficit. We proposed spending over $50 billion on those initiatives. A few months later, we have a Liberal government back in power proposing to spend over $50 billion on similar initiatives. But guess what? Now it will not drive Canada into deficit because now it is the Liberals doing it. Apparently somehow that makes a difference in how much money we have. I just want to point to that duplicity. It was completely dishonest. Unfortunately they got away with it, but I hope that Canadians will note what they have done and be mindful of that as we approach another election. We have some criticism of this budget. I know people have pointed to the fact that we have said we will not bring down the government on this budget. It is true. We will not. We will not bring down the government because we think it has made some positive steps in certain areas. We are happy to see that. Again, it is an acknowledgement that the Conservative Party was correct on these things. We do not think it went far enough and fast enough in some areas, there is no question about it. I will talk about that in a moment, but it is also true that the Conservative Party is here to serve Canada and we want to make this minority Parliament work. We think we can twist some arms to get the government to do some positive things. We have already done that. We recently passed a motion that really has forced the government to have independent forecasters come in, look at the books of the government and determine how large surpluses will be down the road so the government cannot again play games with these surpluses. It is trying to play games, but now we have an independent set of numbers and can say, \u201cWait a minute, we can see that government is lowballing the size of the surplus\u201d. It is doing that actually; it is lowballing the size of the surplus going into next year and the years after, next year by $4 billion alone. That is why we are arguing it could do more, but I want to set that aside for a moment. We are here to serve the public. Canada does not want an election today. That is very clear. We understand that. We are willing to try to make this Parliament work, but having said that, we are also going to twist Liberal arms to make sure that it works not for the Liberal Party but for Canadians. We have criticisms. I have touched on a couple of them already. One of the criticisms we have is on the huge increase in the cost of the bureaucracy over the last number of years. Since 1997 the cost of the bureaucracy in Canada has gone up 77%. Despite that, the government, even though it has lots of money for its own boondoggles and lots of money for the cost of the bureaucracy, gave a very begrudging tax cut to low income Canadians. When it comes to ensuring that people at the low end of the income scale have a few more dollars in their pockets, the government provides them with a $16 tax break on their tax bill next year. I could spend that $16 in a parking meter. That is $1.25 a month. That is like a down payment on a large coffee at Tim Hortons. That is clearly inadequate; in fact, it is an insult. The government has to refocus and start to treat Canadians with a little respect. Over the last dozen years Canadians have seen their take home pay frozen. They have seen no rise at all in their take home pay. Don Drummond, former deputy minister of finance and now chief economist at the TD Bank, has said over and over again that Canadians must have a national pay raise. The only way that can happen is if the government changes its priorities. It has to ensure that some of the surplus it generates is turned back to Canadians in the form of lower taxes. That must happen for the working poor and for middle income Canadians who often feel as if they are left out. They need to get that break. We in the Conservative Party think that many of these measures are too little too late. I would say the same thing about national defence. When the government announced its spending on national defence, it simply reannounced a number of things it had already announced, things like spending on medium range helicopters. The government made these announcements before, but they were put in the budget to make it sound like it is a great big number. Of course we appreciate the spending on defence, and of course it should be there, but let us not pretend it is more than it really is. That is what the government does every time. It reannounces old spending and does it over a multi-year period so it sounds like a great big number, but when it is spread out over five years it is a lot less impressive. We need to keep that in mind. There are many things the government still has to do. Some of these contributions are welcome, but as our defence critic pointed out, there is still not enough money for maintenance of existing equipment. There will be some purchases of new equipment, which is welcome, but there is not even enough money for the maintenance of existing equipment. The government has to do a lot more when it comes to ensuring that we look after the Canadian military. They are the people who defend us, the people whom we count upon to be our face in the world when they go on peacekeeping missions and when they deliver disaster relief as they did during the tsunami crisis in southeast Asia. The Conservative Party has many other concerns with respect to this budget. One of the big concerns I have as finance critic is the government has announced a number of measures where it has committed huge amounts of money, such as $5 billion for child care and $5 billion for climate change initiatives, but there are no plans attached to them. I get worried when the government oversees big pools of money and there are no plans as to how the money will be distributed to meet certain objectives that are in the public interest. That looks like a boondoggle in the making to me. The child care and climate change initiatives are going to cost $10 billion. We should all be sore afraid. The Auditor General condemned the government for setting up foundations where Parliament had no oversight, where there were no performance audits. It looks like the exact same thing with those two programs in particular. We are concerned about that as well. My leader has said and I am saying that we will not defeat the government on this budget. We want to work with this minority Parliament in the interests of Canada. We know it has only been eight months since the last election. We have already had three elections in eight months in my part of the world in Alberta. I do not think Canadians want to have a fourth. We will also hold the government to account. We will try to amend pieces of legislation that deal with some of these specific measures as they come through the House and committee to improve them.

I am frankly quite dismayed at the continued lack of respect and attention that agricultural producers and hard-working families have received in the 2005 budget. Farmers will get no more cash in their pockets this year from the budget's agricultural programs, or should I say the lack thereof. Despite Agriculture Canada's forecasts of another year of negative total net income, there are no additional funds for producer income support this year. The $26 million a year in cash advances for livestock producers that was promised is a mere drop in the ocean and it will not even kick in until next year if at all. The budget has almost $100 million in recycled and reannounced promises. What is even worse is that the money is not even for farmers but for industry. This is money that was not delivered as promised. It is recycled. It is redirected, to use the government's own words. The $80 million of it will now go to managing the removal of specified risk materials and to handling those issues, and $17 million will go to the fabled loan loss reserve program. I have to wonder which of the government's September promises are not being kept and at whose expense. To highlight the government's lip service to the agricultural community we have recently learned that the agriculture minister's often bragged about $66 million loan loss reserve program is a sham. It does not exist. The program announced on September 10 of last year was supposed to help stimulate additional slaughterhouse capacity in the country, slaughter capacity that is most desperately needed. Members of the Canadian Bankers Association testified before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food this week that for all intents and purposes the program does not exist. The admission that the program is non-existent is frankly stunning. It is also an insult to livestock producers so desperately impacted by the BSE crisis. Yesterday the Minister of Finance announced that $17 million is to be redirected to this non-existent program. The minister is simply offering would-be slaughterhouse investors the sleeves off his vest. It should be noted that this unprecedented situation has devastated not only cattle farmers but other livestock producers as well. In the absence of any real action from the federal government, all four western provinces have developed a BSE program to compensate producers of elk, deer, bison, sheep and goats. Other ruminant and cervid producers left high and dry by the minister have demanded and continue to demand action from the government. The 2005 budget would have been an ideal opportunity for the government to show that it has heard the calls of the other ruminant producers. However, their calls once again have fallen on deaf years. On this occasion, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the agriculture minister this question. When will he ante up and kick in the federal portion of funding for these other ruminant programs already committed to by the western provinces? With regard to the Canadian agricultural income stabilization or CAIS program, the Liberals seem to be taking a Jekyll and Hyde approach. Just two weeks ago the Liberals voted against our motion to drop the CAIS cash deposit requirement. The member for Winnipeg South voted against it, as did the Prime Minister, the finance minister, the agriculture minister and his parliamentary secretary. Now in a complete about face they say that they want to get rid of it. It was the Conservative Party that brought forward the motion. It was the Conservative Party that was pushing for it. The Liberals are now trying to take credit for something that they actually voted against just two weeks ago. We hope they mean that they want to get rid of it this time and we hope, for the sake of our farmers, that they will do something about it and do it soon. The same day they voted against removing the cash deposit requirement, the same Liberals voted against honouring the commitment they had already made to our agricultural producers. So pardon me if I cynically say that I will believe it when I see it. After all, the Liberals committed $71 million in relief to the tobacco farmers of my area, guaranteed to be delivered by October last year. So far they have failed to honour this commitment as well, so my cynicism is well learned. With regard to total new funding for agriculture, the budget offers a paltry $130 million. This new money is not for producers either; it is for bureaucrats and consultants. It will not give any farmer the money that many desperately need just to plant this spring. This is shameful. At a time when farmers' realized net income is at an all time low, the government is sending a clear message to producers right across this country that farmers do not matter to this Liberal government. The minister himself confirmed this earlier today when he said that he does not always get what he wants at the cabinet table. What was desperately needed in the budget was: tax deferrals on 2004 income for producers hit by drought, crashing commodity prices and BSE; tax incentives to increase domestic beef and ruminant slaughter capacity; and the provision of direct loan underwriting for the development of increased slaughter capacity, not to mention crop insurance improvements. In terms of providing real relief for hardworking families, the steps taken by the Liberals in the budget do not go far enough or occur fast enough to have a significant impact on the well-being of Canadians. The Liberals would rather grow the size of the government than grow the incomes of Canadians. The cost of the bureaucracy has grown 77% since 1997. Yet, the Liberal tax relief promised in the budget will amount to just $16 this year for low and middle income Canadians. Furthermore, any additional tax relief is back loaded to 2010. This is an outrage. Hard-working families deserve a bigger break than these piddling measures that the Liberal government has promised. The status quo is not acceptable. With various crisis situations affecting our farmers right across this country at this time, the Canadian agricultural community is in its worst financial position since the years of the Great Depression. Agriculture Canada's own forecast of negative total net income for yet another year confirmed this, but the Liberal budget ignores it. Once again the Liberals seem to be saying that our farmers should just wind down their farms, move into the city, and get real jobs, ones that will allow them to pay more income tax for the Liberal government to squander. Our farmers deserve more respect than this. Clearly the Liberal government does not value the contributions of hard-working farm families. To put things in context, Ontario corn producers are currently getting less money per tonne for their corn than the city of Toronto is getting per tonne of garbage. That is right, corn is worth more after it has been used than before. The government must change its priorities. Agriculture is a key economic driver of this country and the security of our food supply depends on farm families who work very hard to provide us with the high quality food that we eat. Canadians across this country want a safe, secure food supply, and they deserve it. Our farmers want to supply it, but increasingly they are finding it impossible to do so. The government has a responsibility to ensure that farmers receive responsive relief in real time. They do not need phantom funds. They do not need deferred dollars and they do not need the sleeves off of the government's vest. Farmers across this country need relief and they need it now. The budget has failed to provide it, and for that reason, I will not be supporting it.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20050322-1529.2.1.30", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Garry Breitkreuz", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2005-03-22", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Saskatoon\u2014Rosetown\u2014Biggar. I will begin my speech by letting people know watching via television exactly what the agreement is that we are talking about today. This is a federal program. It is in our charter. I cannot understand why the federal government would not treat all provinces equally when this is part of the agreement into which all provinces have entered. The government is cherry-picking in deciding this province gets this and that province gets that. I will state what the agreement is. Under part III \u201cEqualization and Regional Disparities Commitment to promote equal opportunities\u201d, section 36(1) states: Without altering the legislative authority of Parliament or of the provincial legislatures, or the rights of any of them with respect to the exercise of their legislative authority, Parliament and the legislatures, together with the government of Canada and the provincial governments, are committed to (a) promoting equal opportunities for the well-being of Canadians; (b) furthering economic development to reduce disparity in opportunities; and (c) providing essential public services of reasonable quality to all Canadians. It goes on to say: Commitment respecting public services... (2) Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. This is what we are talking about and this is what I will make my remarks on today. As we read this, equality for all Canadians is the very purpose in the federal government's equalization program. This is provinces rich in resource revenue helping out those struggling to provide their residents with the services to which every Canadian has the right. In theory, the rationale for equalization makes perfect sense. In reality, however, some provinces are being stripped of their resource revenues and, in turn, their ability to provide their population with those adequate services like timely waiting times for surgery and MRIs. A national program has to be applied equally to all provinces. That is the essence of what I have to say today. Special deals made by the Prime Minister have left provinces, like Saskatchewan, on the outside looking in and wondering when they too will be treated equally. Saskatchewan has been cheated by the Liberal government when it comes to fairness. This have province, which has seen its agriculture industry devastated by weather and trade issues, does have a bright spot: its natural resources. However, instead of allowing the province of Saskatchewan to support its people using revenues from oil and gas, the federal government instead uses it to provide residents in other neighbouring provinces, like Manitoba, British Columbia, Quebec, with a better quality of life. Saskatchewan is certainly not being treated equally through equalization. Until very recently, Saskatchewan was not alone in the fight to keep resource revenues. It took a lot of effort by Newfoundland and Labrador, Premier Danny Williams, but our Prime Minister obviously saw a problem with the equalization formula when it came to provinces like Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, and from that we saw the signing of the Atlantic accord. Both Atlantic provinces can now keep their offshore revenues and provide so much more for their residents. Why not a similar agreement for Saskatchewan? The Liberal MP from the province knows first-hand the struggle for daily survival in Saskatchewan, at least he should. Yet all he can offer as support for his constituents and the residents of the province are a few empty words about what the Government of Canada wants. Oddly enough, what the Government of Canada wants is exactly what Saskatchewan wants, and that is fairness. If we all agree on that, why is the province of Saskatchewan being forced to beg the Liberal government for an agreement like the one just signed by Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia? The words of the Prime Minister at the Saskatoon airport recently have the people of Saskatchewan outraged. Not only was Saskatchewan not allowed on board in January when the last agreement on equalization was signed with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, but the big deal made six months ago that Saskatchewan reaped so greatly from was actually, if we look at it, money owed to the province. Saskatchewan has been ripped off by the federal government when it comes to equalization. Just six months ago the federal Liberal government corrected past inequities and the money Saskatchewan was supposed to be rewarded with six months ago was the province's money all along. The Liberal government and the Prime Minister have said time and again that they all want to alleviate western alienation. Penning a deal with two eastern provinces while denying a western province the right to its resources and a light deal is hardly a step forward. What it all comes down to is the definition and difference between a have and have not province as outlined within the equalization program. Because Saskatchewan is rich in oil and gas, 2 of the 33 base components used in calculating equalization determine that Saskatchewan is a have province. This dubious honour has been bestowed despite the hardships facing the agricultural industry in Saskatchewan and the out-migration of people. Because of equalization, revenues from the very resources that are keeping the province afloat are being handed to the federal government which in turn distributes the money among the have not provinces. We are seeing Saskatchewan, which is in absolute distress, supporting its neighbours. By all real indicators, Saskatchewan is far from a have province. It is not a knock to the people of Saskatchewan but to high ranking political officials like our finance minister who knows firsthand the financial struggle of the province's key industry, that being agriculture. At least he should. Our beef, sheep and other producers have been ravaged by the BSE crisis and grain farmers have had to endure year after year of weather related crop failures, the most recent being the untimely frost last August. Countless farm families have to sell off their machinery, animals, land and homes because their input costs far outweigh their income. Yet, we are regarded as a have province. I want to go through some statistics. First, the Fraser Institute indicates just how serious the problem is in Saskatchewan. We have the longest waiting times for surgery in the nation at 24.5 weeks. By comparison, Manitoba has the shortest wait time at 7.8 weeks, yet Saskatchewan has to transfer money to Manitoba. Saskatchewan has the longest wait times for MRIs at 25 weeks. Manitoba's MRI wait is 11 weeks. But this year Saskatchewan will receive only $71 million in equalization transfer payments while Manitoba will receive 20 times as much at $1.433 billion. Over the past 10 years Manitoba has received approximately $800 million more per annum than Saskatchewan in equalization payments. There is even more evidence of the problems with equalization. Canada's average per capita income for 2003 was $29,341. In Saskatchewan the per capita income was almost $5,000 below the national average. Saskatchewan pays the high cost of educating its kids who then move to other provinces. Saskatchewan possesses the second highest level of net citizen migration. At the height of the Great Depression, Saskatchewan had a population of 930,000 people. Today its population is barely more than that at 995,000, a 14% increase over 70 years. Saskatchewan's population has declined by 24,000 from 1996 to 2004. Saskatchewan's net debt is nearly $1 billion or almost $10,000 of debt for every man, woman and child living in the province. Saskatchewan has the fourth highest net debt of the 10 provinces yet the province's oil and gas revenues are going to provinces with much less net debt. As an aside, we need to have those resource revenues available so we can pay off this debt. Saskatchewan is the only province in Canada to not fully fund its share of farm safety net programs. The province's premier claims he cannot afford it, but does no one see the obvious contradiction? On one hand, the government is telling the people in Saskatchewan that everything is great, it is a have province, and on the other hand, the federal Liberals sit by while the province admits it cannot fund certain programs in the agriculture sector. We want fairness for the province. I will conclude by saying that by removing non-renewable resources from the equalization formula, provinces like ours would possess an incentive to expand their economies around their natural resource base and become a true have province like its neighbours. The current equalization formula is grossly unfair. I know it, the Premiers of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland-Labrador know it, the Prime Minister knows it, and every resident in Saskatchewan knows it.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20041104-1478.3.1.33", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Yvan Loubier", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "2004-11-04", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, I thank the Conservative Party of Canada for providing us with this opportunity to discuss fiscal relations between the federal and provincial governments. This is an important issue. As members know, with the cooperation of the other two opposition parties, to which we are grateful, we launched the debate on what we call the fiscal imbalance. The federal government did not want to recognize the existence of an imbalance, but it is becoming increasingly part of the parliamentary culture. A special committee was even set up, with the support of the parties, following a motion by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which I had the honour of presenting. That motion called for the establishment of a special committee on fiscal imbalance. The committee must report by June 2 of next year on this whole situation, whereby the federal government has way too much money in its coffers, in light of its responsibilities, while provincial governments, including the Quebec government, do not have enough tax resources and tax room to fund public needs and priorities. These include health, education, income support for the poor, social housing and others. We understand the outrage of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, and of Nova Scotia. We sympathize with them. We also share the frustration of the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, and we understand it. I think that an increasing number of Canadian provinces understand the frustration felt periodically by Quebec, because the federal government is not fulfilling its commitments. We have experienced that on many occasions with the Liberal Party of Canada, regarding the numerous promises and commitments made by the government, and it has left a sour taste in our mouths. However, we feel that the motion of the Conservative Party is not the solution to achieve greater harmony in fiscal relations between the federal and provincial governments. It could even create more unfairness and more injustice than the problem that it seeks to correct for Newfoundland and Labrador and for Nova Scotia. What is the situation? The whole debate is on equalization. In fact, what little was said during the election campaign on this issue dealt with as to whether, despite the oil revenues of Newfoundland and Labrador, the payments received by that province would be reduced under the equalization formula. Newfoundland and Labrador wanted the assurance that even if oil royalties were to increase in the future, this would not impact on the equalization payments that the province is getting. Of course, a prime minister who is on the ropes, who fears that power is slipping out of his grasp, is ready to promise anything at all. That is what the Prime Minister did during the election campaign. His words were in the newspapers and on television. He promised that the issue of royalties would not affect the equalization payments of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. He made that promise. He made a series of promises; he was casting them in all directions, and found himself empty-handed at the first ministers conference where he could not keep his word. The problem, fundamentally, is the issue of equalization. We must understand what equalization is, and what it involves. We must understand what a negative effect a motion like this one by the Conservatives could have on the whole system, if the government were to implement it. First of all, what is equalization? Equalization is the only program enshrined in the Constitution. It is the only income redistribution program that\u2014since 1982\u2014has been part of the Constitution. What equalization means is simply this: to ensure that, from sea to sea, provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. This means that the richer provinces contribute, through the federal government, to lessening the disparities that may exist between themselves and the poorer provinces. The essence of equalization is to reduce these disparities and inequalities in order to better serve the population. There is no other way to look at equalization. But now there is talk of differentiated equalization, in which the royalties obtained by a province would be set aside. This would mean carrying on business as usual with an equalization formula that does not take into account this source of income, changing the very essence of equalization and creating the type of inequity that a constitutionalized equalization program is designed to correct. I repeat, this program is one of a kind. How is equalization evaluated? The amount of money that each Canadian province is able to raise from taxpayers in the form of income tax, corporate tax, various other taxes like sales tax and property tax, revenue from natural resources in areas such as mining, hydro power and oil, is determined. Based on this, the fiscal capacity of each province, their respective ability to generate revenue from various categories of activities and taxpayers, is evaluated. Each province is evaluated using the same tax base, that is to say, the same revenue items. On the basis of this evaluation and of a standard corresponding to the average capacity of five out of ten Canadian provinces, it is determined whether or not a given province is entitled to equalization payments. If a province is very rich and has a potential for revenue equal to the five province average, it will not be entitled to equalization. But a province whose capacity is lower than the five province average capacity to raise revenue from the taxpayers will receive equalization payments of an amount equal basically to the difference between the revenue it can raise per capita and the average of this per capita revenue for the five provinces used for calculation purposes. That is the amount that will be transferred to Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador and other provinces. For this plan to work, as I mentioned earlier, the same tax base absolutely must be used for each province. In other words, the same revenues have to be calculated for each province. This brings us to the Conservative Party motion. The Prime Minister made a promise during the election campaign that he did not keep, like so many of his promises\u2014but we will come back to that later. The situation has changed. A source of revenue has just been taken out of the equalization formula that applies specifically to Newfoundland and Labrador. As a result, in calculating the fiscal capacity of Newfoundland and Labrador and comparing it to that of Quebec or Ontario we are no longer comparing the same thing since we do not have the whole picture. Through an ad hoc agreement, we are creating unfairness right from the start. A mockery has been made of the spirit and the letter of the equalization program. We are no longer talking about equalization at all since differential treatment exists. An injustice has just been created. What would justify taking away oil revenues from the tax base equalization calculation, which represents the fiscal capacity of each province, but leaving the revenues generated by hydroelectricity, for example? That is what the Conservative Party proposal is getting at. In Quebec, what right would they have to keep in the equalization formula things like income tax, corporate tax and so forth, including the dividends paid by Hydro Quebec to the Government of Quebec, while next door, in Newfoundland and Labrador, they would take away the oil royalties paid to the government of that province? There is something inequitable here as well as a travesty of the equalization formula, and results in treatment that is unjust compared with that of the other provinces of Canada. This would seem to be like giving a kind of premium to the oil-producing provinces, or in other words a premium for non-renewable resources, one paid for by the provinces that produce clean energy, renewable energy. Sort of like Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec subsidizing oil exploration in Newfoundland and Labrador. There is something rather illogical about all this debate, which creates a link between the particular needs of Newfoundland and Labrador and an equalization formula, which today's motion totally distorts. Either there is equalization in Canada, or there is no longer equalization in Canada. This being a program enshrined in the Constitution and one of the principles of fiscal federalism, proposed in 1947, if I remember correctly by the Rowell-Sirois Commission, which addressed fiscal federalism, redistribution of wealth, and equitable treatment, for example for both east and west, I think that it would be worthwhile maintaining it. However, if we want to look at reforming equalization, there are ways of doing so. There have been discussions on this for close to a dozen years, federal-provincial conferences, meetings between civil servants. No one knows where we are at now, because there are 33 variables in this pesky formula. There are all sorts of ins and outs, ups and downs. As the saying goes, why make something simple when you can make it complicated? One might say the equalization formula has evolved this way over the years. There has been talk of correcting it for 12 years, but no success. There are ways, however. I would like to point out three problems that exist at present. At the beginning of my remarks, I explained that an average is taken of the revenues of five provinces. This five-province average is used as a standard to determine whether or not a province should receive equalization payments. The potential tax revenues of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are taken and added together and then divided by five. It is a simple arithmetical average. Then the potential revenue of each province is compared to this five-province average, and the provinces with revenues less than the average are entitled to equalization payments. Still, what is the logic behind it? Only five provinces are used in this exercise, but there are 10 provinces in Canada, and the territories, of course, but equalization only counts the provinces. Why take five provinces and not all ten? It would be a much more representative, Canada-wide standard of wealth than taking only five provinces. A number of the recipient provinces have been asking for this modification for a long time. It would give a much more accurate picture of each province's ability to generate tax revenues. Why too are revenues not measured correctly? As I said, why make it simple, when you can make it complicated? This is a case where the economists at Statistics Canada and the Department of Finance have shown true originality in recent years to do intellectual backflips lending at econometric heights that are so difficult and so technically complex that the ordinary person is quite discouraged. Why not, for example, evaluate the actual real estate taxes in Quebec and in the other provinces? Well, no; they used what is called in economic analysis a \u201cguesstimate\u201d. I would not want to speak ill of economic analysis; that would be shooting myself in the foot and cheering for the other side, but there are things we do well and things we do not do so well, and this is one we do not do well. Therefore, they use what is called a \u201cguesstimate\u201d, which is an estimate of the potential real property taxes each province could raise, even though it is easy, by simply looking in a Statistics Canada catalogue, to find the real value of property taxes in Quebec, Ontario, or anywhere. That correction alone would change the whole thing and would provide an accurate picture. I will just give one example regarding property taxes. Based on these guesstimates or approximations that are so convoluted and technical that they are beyond most people's comprehension, in Quebec, the per capita real estate wealth is a surprising $71,406. This is the assessment of the per capital real estate wealth, as calculated under the equalization formula. However, the actual wealth figure for 2002 is around $30,621. So, the amount calculated is more than twice the actual figure. Do members see my point? This has the effect of increasing Quebec's fiscal capacity. Moreover, the difference between Quebec's capacity and the five province average is inaccurate, because revenues are artificially inflated. The fiscal capacity in terms of property taxes is the figure I mentioned, the real capacity. However, under the formula, this capacity is more than double the actual figure. There is also the unpredictability factor. We have been talking about it for years. It is not normal to be told, \u201cOver the past three years, you received overpayments totalling $800 million. You must repay that money\u201d. In fact, all the provinces would have to give back money. We doubt that Saskatchewan had to repay its $590 million, but we will get back to this later on. We are taking a close look at the issue. In my view, Quebec is being pushed to pay back its $1.2 billion equalization overpayment. Reimbursement can be made over 10 years. How nice. Nonetheless\u2014this is where we have our doubts\u2014how come Saskatchewan, which owes $590 million to the federal government because of an equalization overpayment, would appear not to have to pay and may have its debt forgiven? The amounts fluctuate from year to year. One year equalization might be positive: an additional $400 million. The following year it could be a whole different story. Two years ago an overpayment was made because our income tax estimate changed and GDP growth also differed from our estimates. It constantly varies like that. There are ways to correct this. If all these major discrepancies\u2014and a few others that I will not get into\u2014were corrected, Newfoundland and Labrador alone would receive an additional $168 million in equalization payments for 2004-05. Simply correcting equalization would give it $168 million more. Nova Scotia would get an additional $291 million. I am talking about a lot of money: some $323 more per capita for Newfoundland and Labrador and $311 more per capita for 2004-05 for Nova Scotia. No injustice or preferential treatment would result. The spirit and the letter of the equalization formula would not be distorted. By correcting the positive aspects of equalization and the imperfections I just described, additional money could be given to Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. It is a question of the equalization formula and maintaining the spirit and the letter of equalization. During the election campaign, we read the agenda of the Conservative Party of Canada. It was very clear. For this reason, we are worried about this going beyond excluding the oil revenues of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. The Conservative agenda states that non-renewable resource revenues should be excluded from the equalization formula. Would that apply across Canada and would that mean that supporting a motion such as this would basically open the floodgates even further and keep potential hydroelectricity revenues in the formula, as I mentioned earlier? It makes no sense. We want to change the equalization formula. We are prepared to work with all the parties in this House, but, for the reasons I just mentioned, we cannot support this motion.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20080207-383.11.1.72", "topic": "Emergency Debate", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Peter Julian", "party": "New Democratic Party", "date": "2008-02-07", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, this is a non-partisan evening so I will compliment the government on the issue of hepatitis C.

However, on the issue of housing, I am sorry but I simply cannot agree with the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Health . I simply cannot agree. The funding that was put forward by the government came out of the NDP budget from three years ago. Even at the time, when we forced the former Liberal government to provide some funding for housing, we knew that was only a first step in what was required in long term investments to re-establish social housing and a national housing program in this country. Some of that money has been taken by the current Conservative government and set aside. It is very slowly flowing, but the reality is that it is far from what is required across this country to address a national tragedy, which is the growing homelessness in the streets of our city.

I simply do not believe that the government is taking this issue seriously and making the massive investments that are required to provide social housing right across this country.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20061208-254.6.1.7", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Scott Brison", "party": "Liberal", "date": "2006-12-08", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today. First, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Wascana who, as finance minister, left the best economic environment inherited by a new government in the history of Canada. As well, we had declining debt to GDP, significant budget surpluses, low inflation and low unemployment. After 13 years of Liberal government, Canadians were extraordinarily well served with fiscal responsibility and economic innovation that gave the new minority Conservative government an opportunity to make some very positive and forward thinking decisions. Unfortunately, those decisions did not come. Unfortunately, we have a neo-Conservative ideology that consumes the Conservative government and threatens both Canada's social progressivity and economic prosperity. Look at what the government has done in just a few months. It cancelled the Kelowna accord, cut literacy programs, slashed $5 million from the Status of Women, slashed programs and funding for museums, killed the court challenges program, which enabled Canadians to defend their charter rights, and cut the GST, while raising income taxes for low income Canadians. The Prime Minister refers to himself sometimes as an economist. He must be the only economist on the planet who would support cutting a consumption tax in order to raise income taxes. Every other country in the world is moving to reduce income taxes and in fact in some cases increasing consumption taxes. This is bad economic and social policy to cut the GST and raise income taxes on low income Canadians. It is a move that has been condemned by the IMF and the OECD. Instead of the minority Conservative government engaging in meaningful discussion around long term tax reform focused on growth, productivity, prosperity and doing the right thing, it is offering Canadians a grab bag of tax trinkets that are designed to buy votes, not to build prosperity or fairness. There is a startling lack of vision. The government cannot look beyond this week's polls. It is so focused on wedge politics and dividing Canadians that it is ignoring the opportunity to unite Canadians around shared national objectives for the future of building a world class sustainable economy. Today I will like to talk about some of the types of thinking and ideas that the Government of Canada ought to be pursuing if we are serious about building that world-class sustainable economy that Canadians desire and deserve, ideas such as: reform Canada's tax and income support system to create a fairer, more competitive and greener Canadian economy; a renewed architecture for income security; help the working poor, which is one of the greatest social and economic challenges facing the country, with a working income tax benefit, which was introduced by the previous finance minister, the member for Wascana , but cut by the minority Conservative government; corporate investment tax reform; and continue to reduce the burden on investment in Canada and on corporate earnings. Canada has the eighth highest taxes on investment out of 61 industrialized countries. The Liberal government had reduced that tax burden on investment. Much more can be done in innovative ways that actually create greater wealth for all Canadians. The government should create long term market based economic opportunities for Canada's aboriginal peoples, building on the success of the urban aboriginal enterprise zone in Saskatoon. It should work with other western Canadian cities to offer that kind of tax advantage and enterprise zone opportunity to Canada's aboriginal people. At the same time, it should create long term economic growth and prosperity and help address the urban aboriginal challenge that Canada faces, particularly cities in western Canadian. It should be harnessing multiculturalism and immigration as economic drivers. For a long time we have treated multiculturalism as a social policy. In fact, with globalization and with some of the fastest growing markets in the world being represented by China, India and Brazil, our multicultural communities represent natural bridges to some of the fastest growing economies in the world. We need to harness that entrepreneurial capacity of our multicultural communities to build those bridges and to strengthen that trade. Instead of doing that in places like China, for example, where Canada has traditionally had a strong trading relationship while at the same time advancing human rights on the agenda with the Chinese government, the Conservative government has actually pursued a policy of isolationism against China. Instead of engaging China on the economy and engaging China on human rights, the government has actually undone a tradition of over 30 years, a tradition of engaging China and creating economic growth and prosperity for the Chinese people and for Canadians and at the same time advancing human rights there. There is only one thing that Richard Nixon and Pierre Trudeau ever agreed on and that was the engagement of China. George Bush and our present Prime Minister agree on isolating China. I believe they are wrong. They are pursuing a policy that is dead wrong economically and is fundamentally flawed from the perspective of the advancement of human rights as well. Putting competitiveness on the federal-provincial agenda, working with the provinces to advance the idea of a national securities regulator, eliminating interprovincial trade barriers, and working with the provinces on a shared services agenda are things the Conservative government should be working on. It should be building on the Services Canada model that enabled the federal government, under the Liberals, to work with provincial governments to reduce the cost of government, improve the quality of services for Canadians, and recognize that there is only one taxpayer. The government must invest in and attract private sector investment to rural and small town Canada through smarter rural and regional development. It should offer investment tax credits for areas of higher unemployment and broadband access for all Canadians. It should be helping rural Canadians and Canadians engaged in the agricultural sector benefit from the green revolution. It should be making Canada a leader in clean energy and environmental technologies, which could be the fastest growing area of the 21st century economy. The Conservative government must make Canada a global leader in the research, development, commercialization and export of clean energy and clean energy technologies as part of Canada's overall strategy of taking a leadership role and reshaping our education, training and innovation strategies. I want to focus on that area today, that idea and the vision of Canada as a global leader in the area of clean energy and environmental technologies. We need to forget the old notion that good environmental policy hurts the economy. Clean energy and environmental technologies are the greatest economic opportunity that Canada has in the 21st century. I believe that politicians of all stripes can sometimes take the economy for granted during good economic times. That would be a huge mistake, because we would lose the opportunity we have to build on the successes of the last 13 years and to move forward on a strong base. The fact is that there are storm clouds on the horizon. Our global competitiveness is slipping while other countries are pulling ahead. In fact, the countries that are pulling ahead of us, such as Finland, Sweden and Norway, are countries that have embraced green technologies and environmental technologies and have understood that greening an economy is not only good for the environment, it is good for business. According to the latest World Economic Forum or Davos survey, Canada has actually dropped to number 16 in the world from number 13 last year in terms of our global competitiveness. These other countries that have embraced environmental technologies, that understand the linkage between good environmental policy and good economic policy, are leaping ahead. At the same time, while our competitiveness is slipping, we are actually enjoying a very significant and high level of prosperity. Let us ask ourselves how we as a country are enjoying such a high standard of living while our competitiveness and relative productivity are slipping every year. The fact is that we are gobbling up non-renewable natural resources as if we have put the oil and the gas under the ground. Our generation is propping up our standard of living by robbing from future generations of Canadians, all while we are destroying the environment. The countries and the companies that embrace the environment as a core priority will prosper in the 21st century. The other ones will be left in the dust. Global warming is a real threat to our planet and our country, but it is also creating major economic opportunities for Canada. In the 21st century, the growing economies of China, India and Brazil will cause the worldwide demand for energy to skyrocket. Canada can take on the challenge of helping the world meet its energy needs while protecting the planet. Both human development and economic growth depend on achieving this dual objective. Energy is Canada's clear global advantage. We can be the world leader in clean energy production, technology and export. What we need is a plan. We need to work with the energy industry to put that plan together and we need to recognize that in fact working to meet our Kyoto targets can, with new thinking and innovation, be good for the economy. The plan that I am talking about today can be good for the environment and good for business. It starts with the tar sands, where we need larger investments in basic research and development and commercialization of new technologies. We need to work with the oil companies and the petroleum companies in the tar sands to produce cleaner energy and to work with them to find new methods to bury the carbon under the ground instead of spewing it into the air. Canada's energy sector is rolling in profits. It should be investing more than 1% of those profits in research and development. Putting a price on carbon and providing tax incentives for research and development can help transform Canada's energy sector from a research and development laggard to a leader. The result could be cleaner oil, cleaner gas, cleaner coal and less carbon being pumped into the air. The tar sands are the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. At the same time, they are remarkably profitable, pouring profits into shareholders' pockets and money into federal and provincial social programs. We need to change extraction methods to do it better and to do it cleaner. It is not enough to lay the responsibility for fighting global warming exclusively at the feet of the energy companies. We must give all Canadian enterprises generous tax relief and fast write-offs to compensate for the cost of environmentally friendly energy technology and materials. Simply put, we have to stop subsidizing companies that pollute and we have to start helping companies that produce clean energy and consume less energy. Canada has among the highest taxes in the world on investment and corporations. We need to focus our tax reductions on activities that reward companies for investing in new technologies to cut their energy use. Smart money is going green. We need to make Canada a magnet for the smart money and talent of this exciting new sector. In 2003, Goldman Sachs estimated that $400 billion of international institutional capital was earmarked for investments in environmental technologies in clean energy. It was $400 billion in 2003. Today, in 2006, according to Goldman Sachs, that number has grown to $3 trillion. Many are comparing the potential impact on capital markets and on business in general internationally, comparing this opportunity that clean energy represents, to the Internet revolution. In fact, some estimate that it will actually create greater levels of economic opportunity than the Internet did. The Internet did create remarkable economic opportunity, but let us remember that if the Internet did not exist we would still be getting up every morning, we would be going to work and we would still be living our lives. The Internet satisfies a desire, a desire to communicate information more rapidly and more efficiently, but it does not really satisfy a need. Environmental technologies and clean energy address a real global need. They will not impact how we live our lives; they will in fact impact whether or not we will be able to live our lives on our planet. The economic opportunities created by environmental technologies I believe will dwarf those created by the Internet revolution. As a conventional energy producer, Canada has a ticket to the best economic game in town. Our goal is clear. Canada can be and should be the world leader in the research, development, sale and export of clean energy and clean energy solutions, everything from wind, solar and biofuel to tidal and fuel cells, and yes, we should have an open and honest discussion about the potential of nuclear. Personal taxes are high in Canada. Why does the government not consider focusing personal tax reduction on tax credits for Canadians who buy green, for green cars, green home renovations and green heating systems? Instead, the government cancelled the EnerGuide program, a program that was actually helping low income Canadians renovate their homes to save energy, to save money and to save the environment. We could go further. CMHC could back eco-mortgages to support environmentally efficient design and renovation. Governments need to do more to go green. That means buying green and building green. As minister of public works, I implemented a program of green procurement. We also initiated in our department the first office of the greening of government in the history of Canada. We were moving through green building design and procurement to green the overall operations of government. The Department of Public Works buys $13 billion worth of goods and services a year. If it buys green, it actually has a huge impact on creating a market for green products and technologies within Canada, ultimately helping to bring down the prices of those products so that ordinary consumers can afford them. The Department of Public Works manages 7 million square metres of office space across Canada. If we lease green office space, and if we design, build and renovate greener buildings, it has a huge impact on the environment and, once again, a huge impact on creating a market for environmental technologies. When governments buy green, when citizens buy green, then companies produce green products. It can create something called green growth. Instead of a gold rush, it could be what I call a green rush. The Stern report to the British government concluded that the price of inaction could be an economic cost as great as $7 trillion. That would be an economic cost greater than that of World Wars I and II and the Great Depression combined. We cannot afford to do nothing. Climate change is a global crisis. The solution will take leadership from Canada, a country with a history of punching above our weight. We have a tremendous opportunity as a country to act and to make a real difference, to engage the private sector, to engage citizens, and to engage Canada's energy sector. It is important that political parties put aside partisanship and work together to develop and implement the best ideas. Parliamentarians who sat in this House in the 20th century worked very hard and looked ahead to help shape a legacy for the 21st century for this Parliament and successive governments, and left a Canada that is one of the most socially progressive societies anywhere in the world. I believe that if we get to work as a Parliament, and if governments, including the Conservative government, wake up and recognize the importance of the environment and the opportunity represented by environmental technologies and clean energy, that the legacy that we work toward at the end of the 21st century can be a Canada that is a global leader in the area of environmental technologies and clean energy, a Canada that has risen to the challenge, and a Canada wherein Canadians are proud of the role that we have played in terms of helping to address the biggest challenge facing the planet in the 21st century. I cannot think of another issue that would engage Quebeckers and all Canadians, particularly young Canadians, that would have a greater impact on national unity in terms of shared national objectives than the environment. This is a tremendous economic opportunity for Canada and a tremendous moral imperative for us to act and act now. I have taken the few minutes I had today to talk about some ideas for the future. That is something that we as parliamentarians ought to be doing more of. I offer these ideas to a government that I fear is going to be unwilling because of its narrow neo-conservative ideological focus to accept them, but I would hope that perhaps in the last 20 minutes I have been able to offer some ideas that would make some sense to the government. If not, we will simply have to replace it in the next election and we will go forward with building a cleaner, greener, more prosperous and productive Canadian economy.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20050412-1537.6.1.2", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Yvan Loubier", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "2005-04-12", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, when we left off, before statements by members and oral question period, I had started to list the reasons we oppose the budget recently tabled by the Minister of Finance. The first reason is the bogus consultation by the Minister of Finance of the opposition parties' critics. He claimed he was open to including the various priorities of the opposition parties in the budget. During our over 60-minute meeting with him, he seemed quite sensitive to each of our proposals. However, here we are, several weeks later, with a budget that makes absolutely no mention of the priorities we had identified to him. Among those priorities is the whole issue of resolving the fiscal imbalance. I had the opportunity, in my seven-minute presentation, to explain the negative impact of this imbalance and what we expected to see in the budget to at least begin to fix the fiscal imbalance. I want to repeat that the government has ample means to resolve this issue. Even given the health accord of last September, the equalization agreement and even the special agreements with Newfoundland and Labrador and with Nova Scotia, we know that, over the next six years and under the current federal tax system, the government will have over $100 billion in surplus funds. And that is a conservative estimate. While the federal government pockets the excess taxes paid by Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, the governments of the provinces and Quebec are having a hard time and are barely achieving their objectives and fulfilling their responsibilities, such as providing front-line services to people. There was the health agreement. It is obvious that the governments of the provinces and Quebec cheered the amounts that were freed up last year. They have been bled dry, in any case, since 1997 by the former finance minister, who is now the Prime Minister, and they lack funds. So any additional $100 million to meet the needs of an aging population is very welcome. But it is clearly not enough. I will use the example of Quebec because it is the one I know best. The agreement last September which provided more than $500 million for health will only produce enough funding to run the Quebec health system for nine days. This amount seems enormous, but the needs are very great as well. As I was saying, when the Prime Minister was finance minister, he cut the Canada social transfer, the transfers for health, education and assistance for the most disadvantaged families. So we find ourselves in a situation in which there is a lack of funds for the governments of the provinces and Quebec. First, there is not even a hint of recognition of the fiscal imbalance, and second, there is no sign of any attempt to resolve it. We also thought that the federal government would be better disposed toward the equalization issue. As we know, the bogus agreement reached last October between the provinces and the federal government only takes the amounts that the federal government paid in 2001-02 for equalization, caps them at $10 billion, which was the amount of the transfer for the recipient provinces at the time, and indexes this amount at 3.5% a year. Such an agreement makes a travesty of the basic, prime objective of equalization. As for the two other agreements with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, we will return to them in a moment. Equalization is there to even out the fiscal capacity of all the provinces so that they can provide a variety of services of equal or nearly equal quality from east to west across Canada. In order to achieve this, the true fiscal capacity, in other words, the capacity of the governments or a province to collect taxes from their taxpayers, needs to be determined. This is no longer done. The federal government simply takes the amount paid in 2001-02 and adjusts it for inflation without taking into account any change in the provinces' wealth. In a given year, a province might receive an equalization payment because of a major setback. For example, if the price of oil dropped considerably, some provinces would perhaps experience some difficulties and might be entitled to equalization. Others could see an increase in cash flow another year, in which case they would not be entitled to equalization. Taking the $10 billion amount from three years ago and simply indexing it without taking into account the change in the situation, is nonsense. This is a travesty of the equalization formula devised in 1947 by the Rowell-Sirois Commission. The agreement reached with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia is an example of this, but worse. We have nothing against Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. On the contrary, we have friends throughout Canada, in the Maritimes and in the west, in particular. I realized this during the work of the Subcommittee on Fiscal Imbalance. We have friends from east to west in Canada, from coast to coast. However, to properly measure a province's fiscal potential, none of its sources of revenue can be eliminated. Nova Scotia's and Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore oil revenues, for example, cannot be excluded from the calculation of these provinces' ability to earn revenues from natural resources, property taxes, personal taxes, goods and services taxes.There cannot be a different treatment in another province that cannot have a special agreement like that. Nothing gets measured if a source of revenue is excluded. But this is what is happening with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, which benefited from a $2.8 billion agreement over 10 years, with the first $2 billion paid already from the surplus of the last fiscal year. Let us consider the amount allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia per capita under the agreement with Ottawa. If the agreement were applied to the residents of Quebec, the province would get a lump sum payment of $38 billion tomorrow morning. That is a lot of money. Mr. McGuinty and Mr. Sorbara of the Ontario government, whom I had the honour to meet three weeks ago in subcommittee proceedings, were disconcerted by this agreement. It means that the per capita fiscal potential of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia exceeds not only that of Quebec, but also that of Ontario. This is how they skewed the system. Equalization is the only program in the Constitution, the aim of which, as I was saying, is to try to standardize provincial tax capacities so that Canadians are served well across the country. However, this objective has been totally ignored. Equalization would no longer exist but would simply be called a $10 billion subsidy indexed to inflation and it would change absolutely nothing. There is one other problem, employment insurance. When I met with the minister, he was all ears and all heart when he spoke of the 60% of unemployed people who are excluded from the EI program. He said this was unfortunate, and was full of compassion at our meeting. Yet there is nothing in the budget to ensure better access and better coverage. There are just a bunch of very limited pilot projects for areas of high unemployment. What kind of government do we have? Not only is its morality open to question now, it has already been questioned because of past actions. It has slashed EI, treated the unemployed as fraud artists, and excluded people who had paid 100% of the contributions to the EI fund when they were working. Yet now 60% of them, or 6 out of 10 workers, cannot benefit from EI. Is that moral? Is this not immorality? Since this government has been in power, that is since 1993, it has done a number of immoral things. When I use that word, I am not referring to the sponsorship scandal, which is just one more thing to add to the dubious immorality of the present Liberal government. There is nothing for the unemployed. I have met with agricultural producers and I am sure my western and Quebec colleagues do as well, every day in their respective ridings. These people are the victims of a disaster caused by one sick cow in Alberta and a ban imposed by the Americans. As a result, there is a total disaster as far as our farmers are concerned. In addition, farmers in Quebec and across the rest of Canada have had negative net incomes for three straight years. Do members know what that means? It means that these producers work 365 days a year or close to it\u2014they do not take vacations because the animals cannot wait\u2014and have nothing to show for it. They do not have one red cent to put in their pockets, even if they have dozens of animals and tonnes of grain to sell. They have been going through this for three straight years. How does the federal government respond to the mad cow crisis, for example, or the grain crisis caused by an increase in American subsidies for wheat in particular? It responds by providing $1 billion, which it was very pleased to announce last week. Farmers have been going through an unprecedented catastrophe for 25 or 30 years now. What does this figure mean for a beef producer? It amounts to $20 a head. For two years, these people have been losing $800, $900 or $1,000 a head, and now they are offered $20, while the government claims that it has done all it can, that it tried to persuade the Americans and develop a coherent policy. Well, these people are all starving. So this is the federal government's response, despite its ability to collect a $100 billion surplus out of our pockets over the next six years. It could have done more to help farmers escape the catastrophe that they are currently going through. In my riding of Saint-Hyacinthe\u2014Bagot and in the rural ridings of most of my colleagues in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, farmers are expressing their dismay, even after the fabulous announcement last week. Nothing is provided for social housing, even though people have been waiting for a long time. All that the government has done since 1991 is invest in maintaining the existing social housing, while nothing is provided for new construction. Many families currently spend more than 50% of their incomes on rent. It is said that when people spend more than 25%, they are living in poverty. When they spend twice that, they are living doubly in poverty. But there is no answer to this in the budget. I will leave it to my colleagues who will follow, including the member for Rosemont\u2014La Petite-Patrie, to speak about the environmental question. In conclusion, those are the reasons why we oppose this budget.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20050214-1513.4.1.17", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Yvan Loubier", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "2005-02-14", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-24, which is a very important bill. I mainly want to go over the fundamental principles of the equalization program. Then we will be better equipped to review the proposals as well as the agreement on equalization reached last fall between the provincial premiers and the federal government. Allow me also, for review and evaluation purposes, to take a look at the $2.6 billion agreement that was just signed between the federal government and the Atlantic provinces\u2014Newfoundland and Labrador, in particular. This will also help us to understand the position the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has taken on Bill C-24. First, what is equalization? Far too often people speak of equalization and far too often they do not really grasp this formula, which dates back to 1947. The report of the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, commonly referred to as the Rowell-Sirois Commission, painted the picture of a type of federal program geared essentially toward one thing. It would be set up so that from coast to coast in Canada, the provinces and territories would have comparable levels of fiscal capacity in order to provide comparable services to their constituents. It is a wealth redistribution program reflecting the fact that, at the time\u2014and I hope it is still there today\u2014there was a concern for inter-regional equity in Canada in terms of the services provided to the public. This program was implemented approximately forty years ago, and it is the only federal program that is constitutionalized, which means that equalization is mentioned in the Constitution, and it is the only transfer program that is actually enshrined in the Constitution Act of 1982. To determine the amount of the equalization payment for a given province, or to determine, in the first place, whether or not a province is entitled to equalization, the fiscal capacity of each province is established . What is fiscal capacity? It is the capacity of each province to raise revenue from their taxpayers, individual or corporate, either through property taxes, direct or indirect taxes, or personal income tax, naturally. There are 33 government revenue sources included in the equalization formula. Once the fiscal capacity of each province has been established, an average is calculated using five of the provinces. This average is then used to set equalization standards to decide which provinces will qualify for equalization because their fiscal capacity is lower than the average of the five provinces used for calculation purposes, and which will not receive any, because their fiscal capacity is higher than this five-province average. Once the provinces that qualify are known, the amount of the equalization payment each one will receive is calculated on a per capita basis. This involves figuring how much a given province needs per capita to reach the average capacity of the five provinces used for calculation purposes, that is, how much it should get in equalization from the federal government to make up the difference . The fundamental principle underlying equalization is inter-regional equity. That is the first broad principle. The second principle underlying equalization is fairness to the taxpayers, ensuring that, regardless of where they live, be it Newfoundland, British Columbia or Quebec, they receive essentially the same level of service. The third principle is the strict and rigorous measurement of each province's fiscal capacity. For that, regular calculations must be done. Each year, the estimates are recalculated and factual data sought for each of the 33 revenue sources, for each provincial government. As a result, each year, it is essential that this fiscal capacity be assessed. If it is not, our outlook might be off. For example, provinces may have gotten wealthier over the previous year or increased their fiscal capacity, so they probably exceed the established average fiscal capacity based on the five-province standard. If so, they would not be entitled to equalization payments, even if they had been entitled to them that year or during the past two years. It is perfectly logical and normal, when a province's revenues and fiscal capacity increase, for its equalization payments to decrease. Everyone knows this. When a province gets richer, its equalization payments necessarily decrease. This principle is completely acceptable and accepted across Canada, particularly in Quebec. It is unacceptable, however, when, first, the annual fiscal capacity of each province is not considered and agreements are negotiated such as the one reached last October, whereby the last payments the provinces received, in 2002 and 2003, would be indexed to inflation, meaning these payments would be increased by an additional factor, each year, without however requiring any recalculations. The last year is used to extrapolate the amounts for the next five years, until specialists can examine this matter and find a better way to allocate or index equalization payments. This is problematic. The very principle of periodic, meaning annual, calculations has just been trampled. We have just been told that the dynamic fiscal capacity will no longer be calculated on an annual basis for each province. Instead, an amount provided in 2002-03 will be indexed to inflation over the next five years, to determine the equalization payment. How can the first principle of equalization\u2014determining the actual wealth of provinces in any given year to see if they are entitled to equalization or not based on the five-province average\u2014be respected? We no longer have this annual picture. Already, one of the fundamental principles of equalization has been violated. I am not sure whether the Minister of Finance is aware of this or not. The Prime Minister should know since he was finance minister for eight years and he had to juggle with the equalization formula. Now we are in a situation where the calculation of the 33 funding sources is ignored year after year and for two years now the government has simply been increasing a predetermined amount. That is the first problem. Another problem is that the equalization formula is dated. For the past 15 years we have been talking about improving it and correcting the implausibilities in calculating the 33 funding sources. Instead of change, instead of implementing any of the suggestions made in all this time\u2014particularly in the past five years\u2014in order to truly achieve greater accuracy in the annual estimates, at the meeting in October the Minister of Finance together with the Prime Minister preferred, as I was saying, to apply an inflation factor to a previously calculated amount. Nonetheless, he has not understood that the amount that was set two years ago was arrived at through an incorrect formula and does not reflect the true fiscal capacity of any given province. Rather than take their work seriously, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance chose to use a faulty formula to calculate the equalization payments for the provinces for the next five years. This is the second rather hazy aspect of this agreement and its terms. So they began with a faulty formula and ended up with a faulty result, of course, rather than doing a thorough job and reforming the equalization formula once and for all, with three or four major improvements. It seems to me that is what ought to have been done, rather than coming up with a dubious agreement like this. I will give just two of the suggestions that have been made over the years to improve the equalization system. First, why use five provinces to establish the national average, so that provinces with a fiscal capacity over and above that figure receive no equalization payments, and those who are under that figure per capita do? Why not use the ten provinces and the two territories? Why not have a proper overview with a calculation of the fiscal capacity of each province and a per capita average for the ten? Then the real average of the ten provinces would be used to determine the amounts and the recipients. This has been discussed for 15 years. I have seen documentation on it ever since 1993. It is enough to make a person's hair stand on end, although in my case that is just a figure of speech, of course. There are piles of documents explaining why the ten provinces need to be included in setting the standard. It does not take that much paperwork to explain that all of the provinces must be included in the calculation. The way an average is calculated\u2014a basic principle I trust the senior bureaucrats have not forgotten\u2014is to take all the data for each participant, in this case each province. Then you divide by the number of provinces. This gives the average. Why use five rather than ten? I invite you to look into this. Apparently there has always been a great deal of effort expended by senior finance officials not to give in to the obvious: an average is calculated by addition and the use of a quotient that includes all participants in the program, i.e. ten provinces and two territories. There is also property tax. My interests are not strictly parochial, quite the contrary. Give ten economists the mandate to find a way to measure a measurable event and I am sure they will come up with ten different solutions, each more complex than the other. That is what happened with the calculation of property tax. Instead of using actual figures showing each province's capacity to raise tax revenue from property taxes in each major municipality for instance, a complex calculation\u2014several pages of calculations in fact\u2014is necessary to arrive at an approximation which experts call a proxy. Given that it has to be uniform for all the provinces, this approximation results in a terrifying formula. Even for math fans who enjoy trying their hand at complex formulas, this one is unbelievable. It is up there with the worse horror stories ever produced by the human mind. Comparing this proxy, this approximation, to actual figures often reveals humongous differences. In property tax revenues, there can be a difference of up to 30% or 35% between the reality and the approximations. A statistician looking at these results would say that the error margin is way too high. A 2% or 3% difference is usually acceptable in approximate calculations, as compared to the reality. But when the difference exceeds 30% or 35%, this means that the calculations are wrong. So, this is one problem among many others with this equalization formula. This fundamental problem actually calls into question this formula's capacity to draw an accurate picture of each province's fiscal capacity. This is the first criticism that can be made. If you start with a defective formula, take the very defective result of this defective formula, say that, over the next five years, this is how it will be in terms of equalization payments and inflate that amount, this simply means that a defective amount obtained through a defective formula has just been indexed. Since we already have all this documentation and all the arguments for improving the equalization formula, would it not have been easy in October, to come up with a new formula instead of fiddling around with this one? The result is that in the years ahead they will stop working on the problem and simply index the 2002-03 amounts. This is one of the criticisms we have with respect to this agreement which, in our opinion, tramples the fundamental goal of equalization, which is really to identify which provinces are richer and which poorer, and ensure that by redistributing the wealth, all the people can be provided with services. There is another problem. It is clear to see that the provinces are unsatisfied with this equalization formula, as they were with last October's agreement. It is clear that there is a basic, even more fundamental issue involving the Canadian provinces, Quebec and the federal government, and that is the fiscal imbalance. Not so long ago, the federal government said that some people called this issue the fiscal imbalance, while other people talked about fiscal pressures. The government, and particularly the Prime Minister, forgot to say that they must have got the words \u201csome\u201d and \u201cother\u201d mixed up. All parties in the House, except the Liberal Party, believe there is a fundamental imbalance between the federal government's ability to get tax revenues from the taxpayers and to fulfill its mandates, but that the provinces are unable to collect revenues to provide services directly to the people, such as health, education, income support, and other services which correspond to their jurisdictions as expressly set out in the Constitution. We find ourselves faced with an agreement in which the problem of fiscal imbalance has not been solved, and it shows. In fact, despite an agreement which the federal government calls very generous, there are still several billion dollars in the federal government's coffers that could be used for purposes other than accumulating political capital, as the Liberals have done, invading provincial jurisdictions, as the federal government has done, especially over the last seven or eight years, since the surpluses first began. In short, this agreement does not solve the whole issue of the fiscal imbalance. The taxing abilities of each province are not addressed. More inequities are created, because we still have a formula that was far from perfect. Therefore, only imperfect numbers will come out of it. More important still, we are also faced with a situation where, after the conclusion of this agreement among the first ministers of the provinces, Quebec and Canada, the federal government and certain provinces reached special agreements. I can name a few of them. I will come back to possible criticism of such agreements. Following last October's equalization agreement, the first special agreement was reached between the Minister of Finance\u2014originally from Saskatchewan\u2014and the Premier of Saskatchewan. This province was offered $590 million. It owed the federal government $590 million in equalization overpayments. The decision was made to reach a special agreement with Saskatchewan. It was not identified as such. That province was told that it would not have to repay this overpayment. It got this money as a gift. In contrast, Quebec had an equalization overpayment of over $2 billion. The government tells us that we will have to repay this money, but that it will be nice to us and give us 10 years to do so. It is the same thing for the agreement with Newfoundland. A special agreement was concluded with Newfoundland, for $2.6 billion. An overall improvement to the equalization formula is dismissed and the waters are muddied. It is impossible to apply a general equalization formula and not consider certain revenues for some provinces and keep revenues for others. That is not how things work. The system cannot work this way. If offshore oil and gas revenues are not considered and hydroelectric revenues in Quebec are included, an inequitable situation has been created, which adds to the inequity I mentioned with regard to this imperfect equalization formula. We will have the opportunity to talk about this during questions and comments.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19940503-1070.2.1.12", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Pierre Brien", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "1994-05-03", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, I am extremely happy to participate in today's debate on a subject very close to my heart. When I decided to run for political office, I had two major goals in mind: the first, of course, was to bring about full sovereignty for Quebec, and the second was to create a fairer, more equitable tax system, since it accounts for a large part of the social contract between individuals and the government and is presently the cause of much of the dissatisfaction people feel for their elected representatives. Today's debate is also, in my view, very timely. Yesterday was the deadline for filing income tax returns. Many people likely spent the weekend working feverishly at the last minute to properly complete their tax returns. Just yesterday, I was completing a tax return for a friend. I enjoy this task, but I know that many people find the process quite difficult and quite complex. There must not be many people who are totally familiar with the ins and outs of the Income Tax Act, given its complexity. Year after year, new amendments are made. The end result is an extremely complex piece of legislation. The same could be said of the Goods and Services Tax to which some Liberal members made reference a while ago. This tax is also extremely difficult to understand and fraught with complexities and regulations. The GST legislation is almost as voluminous as the Income Tax Act. In moving his motion, the hon. member for Calgary Centre touched on one alternative that he would like to discuss. While I do not necessarily agree with the aims or technical aspects of his proposal for a single tax rate, I do think that all options deserve to be weighed. This is a serious proposal, one that should be given due consideration. Having said this, I do have some reservations, although I am not an expert on this single tax. First, I am not convinced that this would really be a more progressive, more equitable tax. Of course, a single tax rate that would apply to all incomes may seem rather simple, but would it really result in a system that was fairer and less regressive than the current one? I somehow doubt it, because there are many ways to avoid declaring income. This option would have to be carefully considered. On the other hand, it does not leave us any leeway in using taxation as a social and economic development tool. I know this is one of the arguments of those in favour: taxation must not be a social and economic development tool; alternatives must be found. Personally, I think it can be a very useful tool. Let me give you an example. In 1987, in my region, the economy was going full steam. We came very close to full employment, with 6 per cent employment rate, and we were doing very well. One of the main reasons for this success was mining exploration, an activity strongly encouraged by way of deductions for flow-through shares. Toward the end of that expansion period, the governments attacked this deduction, and you should have seen the tremendous impact this had on our region. Today, research does not even ensure availability of sufficient reserves any more. Trouble lies ahead ten years down the road, maybe less, because we are not discovering enough mineral reserves. Problems are already starting to show up in our region, and that is a serious situation. But we used to have a tax incentive, a tool that allowed and encouraged people to make investments. You know how risky it is to invest in a mining exploration company. The taxpayer would put money into shares, but in recognition of the risk factor, the government shared the risk via tax incentives. Interestingly enough, this is not a direct subsidy by which the government gives money to people and tells them: \"Go and do research\". Instead, the government is supporting investments made by individuals in the private sector. So, the risk is shared. I think this is the sort of interesting tools afforded by the tax system. Let us not be mistaken in thinking that only high-income taxpayers took advantage of this; many middle-income people in our region were attracted by all the spin-off benefits their investments could have. The nice thing was that when you picked a company that struck an interesting deposit, then, it was almost like winning the lottery. How can we encourage these businesses? I would like those who support this kind of tax to explain how they will promote economic development, especially in higher-risk areas. The government has a duty to intervene when investments may be insufficient due to various factors. That is what I wanted to say regarding this tax. Now, if we look at the current tax system as a whole, I think that, to resolve any problem, we must follow a certain procedure. First, we must analyze the situation carefully; make a diagnosis; identify alternatives and make a choice. But there is also a subsequent step that the government often forgets: following-up on the choices that were made. The Auditor General often talks about it. Many government programs are not assessed properly after their implementation. The same goes for tax measures. That is why we think it would be interesting to look at overall expenditures-not only budget but also tax spending-to examine, assess and follow up on them and to study their impact in the last few years. Of course, the Liberals were full of good intentions when they were in opposition. It led them to write the red book that I will not quote because I sent it to recycling when I realized it was only wishful thinking. Very little is put forward in this House. I would like the Liberal government to be a little more serious. They cannot always fall back on the argument that their four-year mandate gives them enough time to act. There are always things that need to be done. We cannot wait for four years. They can rest easy, they will not run out of things to do. And we can start right away. Earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance talked about the committee's heavy workload due to the GST and Bill C-17. However, when the GST report is tabled on June 1, the committee will then be free to deal with family trusts in June. Parliamentarians will be available in June as Parliament will still be sitting. Yes, there will be other minor bills but given how long we worked on the Goods and Services Tax, we could examine family trusts. However, the government should give out information and put figures on the table. But they prefer to wait until the fall to gain time, to stall for another year; other issues will be raised and they will find other reasons to prevaricate. Playing for time is the best way to avoid dealing with a problem. And that is what they are doing. And they ease their conscience by saying that it is in the latest budget and that they will start to do something. Hold on there-we shall see; I have my doubts. In the past, some people dealt with taxation. There were important commissions, the Carter commission, the Rowell-Sirois commission; at that time principles were expressed that are still current today. We should deal with them instead of starting all over. The public feels frustrated and their frustration is rather justified. Often, committees and commissions of inquiry are set up to analyze problems. They identify the problems very well and produce very fine three- or four-volume reports; a huge number are printed and copies are available everywhere, but often these recommendations remain on the shelf. Although the problem must be restated for today's conditions, these reports often contain some very worthwhile things. As I said in my introduction, the tax system is an important part of the social contract; it is how revenue is collected from taxpayers to pay for the government's expenses. Individuals now have a terrible feeling of unfairness which puts a very strong pressure on them to somehow right the balance. What do they do? They encourage the underground economy because they feel that it is the right thing to do for themselves. And you must understand where they are coming from, given some data from the 1980s. For example, look at the wealthiest 1 per cent of the population. I have some reservations about the figures that I will give, but I heard them from the member for Gatineau-La Li\u00e8vre. Even if they are not totally accurate, they certainly are indicative of the trend. In 1980, the highest percentile, the richest 1 per cent, owned 16 per cent of Canada's total wealth. Ten years later, with the recession in the early 1980s and the economic slowdown in the late 1980s, this top percentile held 26 per cent of the wealth, an increase of 10 per cent in the 1980s. It is not surprising to hear middle-class people say that they feel they were strangled in the last decade, that they felt a lot of pressure. People live with it every day and resent it and that is what spurs on our underground economy. Let me give some other figures, Madam Speaker. Let us look at government revenue, starting with 1981, so that we can better see what happened. In 1981, federal and provincial governments together collected $34 billion in personal income taxes. In 1991, that amount had reached $100 billion. Let us now take a look at corporate income taxes. In 1981, $11.7 billion were collected in such taxes, compared to $18.3 billion in 1991. Obviously, the progression is far from being the same, which explains why a small percentage of Canadians were able to get richer. If you look at the breakdown for each province and the federal government, you can see that the pattern is the same everywhere. I want to say a word on personal income tax, because last Friday we learned something which nearly went unnoticed and which is almost outrageous. Revenue Canada employees complain about political interference when auditing corporations. Last Friday, I raised this issue in the House. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Revenue said that there was no concrete evidence justifying an inquiry. I am sorry, but 300 persons filled out a questionnaire. As you know, when a survey is conducted by sending out a questionnaire, there is always a space for comments at the end. People usually do not fill out that part. They just quickly answer the multiple-choice questions. However, in that case, 300 people out of 4,000 filled out that part of the questionnaire. Three hundred people bothered to make comments. More than that in fact, but 300 complained about political interference when auditing some company files. This is really serious. Of course, you may think this was the case only under the previous Conservative government. But how do you know it is not also occurring under the government opposite? After all, once the Liberals and the Conservatives find themselves on the other side of the House, their policies are pretty similar. In fact, they are quite similar, and that is a real concern. We also referred to the GST. I was not going to discuss this tax, but I have to do it. I am not sure that Canadians and Quebecers fully understand the commitment made by the Liberal Party during the election campaign. The Liberals said they would eliminate the GST, but they also whispered that they would replace it with something else. That was mentioned in the following paragraph. I am not sure how people reacted. However, I can honestly tell you that residents in my riding did not believe the Liberal Party. They felt that the Liberals would somehow take the same amount of money from their pockets. Whether the Liberals were going to change the name or the structure of that tax, people were reluctant to trust them. I will not get in to what is being done in committee. I am a member of the committee, so I know perfectly well what is happening there, but I must say I am concerned. We get the impression that the expanding underground economy is connected only with the coming into effect of the GST, but it is far more complicated than that, and just reforming the tax is not going to restore confidence, especially since the objective is quite clear. The instructions of the Minister of Finance are to find an alternative that will produce as much revenue: $15 billion. The rates may be different on certain products but on the whole, the objective is still to take another $15 billion out of taxpayers' pockets. How do you expect the consumer to perceive this as a major and effective reform? I agree that in the case of businesses, there are a lot of things that can be done to simplify the system, which would bring costs down, and consumers would benefit to some extent. However, they are certainly not going to reduce operating costs by $15 billion. That does not make sense. The cost of administering the tax, which is very high, is around $600 million. A number of Liberal members tend to confuse the issue when they talk about GST administration costs. Now, I do not necessarily want to defend this tax, but I would like to explain what we are talking about here. The total revenue is around $29 billion, but businesses are entitled to claim an input tax credit, which is quite common in the case of a value-added tax. If we take away the cost of input tax credits for businesses, not a tax that must be paid but a refund, and we subtract as well the tax credits for low income individuals, we have $15 billion left. It is simple mathematics. A number of government members are saying it costs 50 per cent to run the system and to get a dollar you have to spend 50 cents, but that is just not true. It costs $600 million to run the system, and their calculations are all wrong. It is still too much, of course. However, with this political rhetoric, they are just spreading rumours. This is irresponsible, and they should take the trouble to check their facts. So what is the answer? I see I have only five minutes left, but I could talk all day about taxation and tax reform. We must start with a comprehensive evaluation of all tax expenditures. Consider what they were used for and what the objectives were. Were those objectives met? The department publishes information on tax expenditures connected with individual and corporate income tax. When we read this information, we see that a number of data are not available. In the report published this year, the latest year available is 1991, and a number of data are still not available. Is it because they were not calculated or evaluated? I agree in some cases it is very difficult, but in other cases, it is definitely quite feasible. Is it because they don't want to reveal this information? Is that what the Liberal government and the Minister of Finance mean when they talk about transparency and profess to be very staunch advocates of government transparency? I am not certain, but I hope not. I hope they plan to produce reports that are far more serious. We can give them the benefit of the doubt, since they had only recently been elected. Perhaps this reflects a tendency on the part of this government, but in any case, we will no longer accept publications such as this one. There are two sides to a balance sheet, the revenue side and the expenditure side. Regardless of the measures taken to improve the fairness of the tax system and the way in which revenues are collected, we cannot forget that there is a serious problem on the expenditure side. Revenues are collected to cover expenditures, but these expenditures are exorbitant. Consumers, who are also voters, view a number of these expenditures as wasteful, and rightly so. The first step toward significantly reducing government spending is to eliminate this waste. The Prime Minister has told us that it is the responsibility of committees to review spending item by item. The members on this side of the House are not afraid of this task and are ready to take a go at it. I am happy to see that Reform members are also willing to take on this task. However, when we introduced a motion calling on committees to have the responsible ministers testify, only two of the fourteen committees agreed to the motion. Two out of fourteen! Another shining example of the Liberal's brand of transparency! There is the Minister of Finance, although this is not the biggest operating budget, and there is also the Minister of Human Resources Development who manages a fairly large budget. But does he intend to testify? It is almost scandalous. Before concluding, I would like to mention a number of areas on which we are prepared to concentrate our efforts. Mention was made of family trusts. I know that one of my colleagues will be speaking about this issue later and that my colleague from Rosemont spoke about it earlier. There is also the matter of a minimum corporate tax. We currently have a capital tax which is a form of minimum tax. However, since it is possible to reduce the tax level to zero, this is not a real minimum tax. The year 1987 is notorious for a figure now making the rounds in Canada. That year, a number of corporations earned $27 billion in profits without paying a penny in taxes. That is a shocking statistic. The public is hard-pressed to believe that the tax system is fair when it hears statistics like these. Also scandalous are tax havens, the tax treaties signed with other countries that allow people to evade the tax system to some extent. These were repeatedly denounced by the Auditor General. We will be looking into it shortly at the Finance Committee and I hope the minister will give us clear indications on what he intends to do. The measures announced in the budget are clearly insufficient and will not solve the problem. We have to review all tax treaties and put into place a truly operative minimum income tax system. One such system was introduced in the United States by Ronald Reagan, who is hardly the greatest socialist in the history of mankind. Why could we not do the same thing here? In terms of corporate tax, the situation is much better in Canada than in other countries. So, there is food for serious thought here and I would like to draw this parallel with the GST before closing, Madam Speaker. When the tax on business inputs was removed, who gained from the introduction of the GST? The businesses with inputs on which the tax was removed. Since my time has run out, Madam Speaker, I will simply tell you that we have been in favour of a tax system reform for a long time and are prepared to work at that. The government should act responsibly and, in the year to come, the days to come, it will have to put something on the table so that we can start real discussions and find real solutions to a problem perceived as very serious by consumers and voters.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19970307-1432.3.2.1", "topic": "Oral Questions", "role": "mp", "speaker": "John Williams", "party": "Reform", "date": "1997-03-07", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, the Liberal-Tory years have been hard years for the one and a half million unemployed in Canada.

It is important to look at this bill in the current context, but it is also appropriate to go back in time and look at the historical context. When the government created the Canadian Wheat Board, Canada, like every other country in the world, was going through a major economic crisis. It was in the 1930s, more than 65 years ago, that the federal government established the Canadian Wheat Board. At the time, there was widespread famine, and men and women often worked just to put food on the table. Some people starved during this period called the Great Depression. Western farmers had great difficulties making ends meet. They were often stuck with their crop, because they could not sell it at a fair price. The government, like a good father, created the Canadian Wheat Board and gave it a monopoly. All the grain had to go through the CWB. At the time, the creation and the existence of the Canadian Wheat Board seemed justified. It would still be justified today were it not for the fact that, over the years, the government lost touch with the grassroots. This is especially true of the current Liberal government, which is totally out of touch with the grassroots. It seems this government only listens to financial interests, to those who contribute to its campaign fund. Western farmers are very upset. Earlier, I was listening to the Reform Party member who said: \"If you want war in western Canada, you will get it with grain producers because they are so upset\". I think he exaggerated. There will not be war, well maybe a verbal one, but that will not be all that bad. I can tell you that, of all the amendments and proposals we put forward in the Standing Committee on Agriculture, very few were approved, although some of our motions were very interesting, but the Liberals, with one exception, after consulting the great one himself, the minister that is, turned around 48 hours later and passed the motion requiring the election of 10 farmers, and 10 was the number put into the bill. Sixty years ago, there was a need for the Canadian Wheat Board. I think there still is today, but the government should wake up and make some changes. A good number of motions have been introduced, and it could accept a few of them. It should also be remembered that the Canadian Wheat Board has a monopoly, in the sense that a grain producer living on the border with the United States would not have the right, nor did he before, to sell his crop or a part of it for more than his American neighbours. The Canadian Wheat Board undertakes to buy wheat and barley from any registered grain producer and is expected, obviously, to get the highest price possible, domestically or abroad, for this wheat and barley. All wheat and barley for human consumption must go through the Canadian Wheat Board. Even in Quebec, if you need an amount of wheat for human consumption, not for feed, you must go through the Canadian Wheat Board. There will be 15 on the board of directors. That is already an advantage. Before, with four or five, there were always one or two that had to be reappointed. But the Canadian Wheat Board has often been directed by three people. Now, there will be 15, 10 of them because of the efforts of the opposition, of the Bloc Quebecois, with the support of the Reform Party. Our Liberal friends did not want to include this in the bill so, after 48 hours of consideration, they consulted the great one himself, who said: \"All right, the west is making such a fuss that we will give them 10\". I myself would have preferred to see 12, of course, as the Reform Party would have, but the Liberals wanted to hang on to the possibility of rewarding the faithful, because the five others will be appointed by the governor general in council. Although the parliamentary secretary to the agriculture minister was naturally not too happy about it, I asked senior officials: \"Would you tell us the salaries of those now sitting on the Canadian Wheat Board?\". At this point, I would urge all my colleagues in the House to listen very carefully. Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that the president of the Canadian Wheat Board earns quite a bit more than you do, even though he does not have to go to the polls? His salary ranges from $115,000 to $144,000. I guarantee you, and you can check this out, that the incumbent is not a Conservative, but a Liberal. His assistant earns between $110,000 and $129,000, as do the commissioners. Indeed, it is often a choice spot to dump a member in order to vacate a riding, as will be done in the coming weeks and days, after the Prime Minister calls an election on Sunday. Someday perhaps the hon. member for Malpeque will be sitting on one of these commissions, earning $144,000 a year, without going to the people, because he knows full well that there is a Conservative wind, and a very strong one at that, blowing on Prince Edward Island. He might be tempted to take a job like that. The parliamentary secretary is smiling; I know he once condemned such appointments, but that is what political patronage is all about. That is why we in the Bloc Quebecois have always denounced, and quite vigorously so, these appointments.

I listened with great interest to the remarks of the member for Berthier\u2014Montcalm. Inquiries of various sorts are a fundamental concern for both Parliament itself, this House, and for the government. Such inquiries are important tools which both Parliament and the government can use to deal with special issues, special problems, special concerns of particular times in our history. Parliament itself has extensive authority in this area. In addition to the inquiries which we are discussing under this motion, which are set up under the Inquiries Act, Parliament has extensive authority to set up a committee or committees to conduct inquiries into any area of concern to members. These committees have the usual full control of the House. Recently there was the special joint committee on the constitution which was chaired by the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. That is an example of a committee which was set up as a national base for an inquiry. In addition, as the member has said, under the Inquiries Act the government, as distinct from Parliament, has the authority to establish commissions of inquiry. In this case a commission of inquiry is created by an order in council under the statutory authority of the governor in council. This provides the terms of reference, the names of the commissioner or commissioners, and establishes the timeframe for the work of the commission. That is important. The government of the day, under the Inquiries Act, sets up an inquiry. It gives it its terms of reference and, as the member said, appoints the commissioners. From that point the inquiry runs as an autonomous, quasi-judicial body. It is the arm's length characteristic of these inquiries which is a very important feature. The member rightly pointed out, and described extremely well, the great powers which commissioners have once such a commission of inquiry is set up and running. Therefore, these are arm's length bodies which the government of the day uses to look at special matters in the public interest. They are set up by law in a very particular way. Any change to the overall mandate of such a commission requires a new order in council. The Inquiries Act recognizes that the government has a role in ensuring that the operation of a commission of inquiry is consistent with its mandate. Commissions of inquiry have been widely used by governments throughout the history of this Parliament and have been an important source of information and policy development. I notice that the hon. member mentioned just two or three commissions of inquiry, but since Confederation there have been over 350 public inquiries under part I of the Inquiries Act. A considerable number of these have had major impacts on Canadian public policy. I would mention the Rowell-Sirois commission on dominion-provincial relations,the MacMillan inquiry into banking and currency, the famous Laurendeau-Dunton commission on bilingualism and biculturalism which has had such an important effect ever since and that was in the 1960s on the way this government operates in a bilingual and bicultural way. I could also mention the McDonald commission into certain activities of the RCMP. Another in the late sixties was the Bird commission on the status of women. That for the government of the day was a conscious effort to look into gender issues, into issues of equality. Again, right through debates in this Chamber to this very day I think we have seen the impact of the Bird commission and the way the government of the day took the time in the sixties to look at gender issues in a broad way really for the first time in our society. Another I would mention is the Donald S. MacDonald commission on the economic union in the 1980s. All of those commissions are examples, as I mentioned, from 350 which have had a considerable impact on public policy in Canada since Confederation. This government is committed to making sure that the terms of reference, the budget and the time limits for completion are made as clear as possible for any commission of inquiry to reduce the risk of undue delays and expenses. To conclude, I would like to thank the hon. member for Berthier\u2014Montcalm for his interest in this important matter. Commissions of inquiry are an important matter. It is a very important aspect of life in this country. I would suggest in considering this motion members should take note of the need to maintain the balance which exists in the Inquiries Act that provides the government with the ability to establish inquiries into public policy matters and not just with that power to establish them, but with the responsibility to ensure the efficient conduct of these inquiries.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.19971209-682.14.1.8", "topic": "Private Members' Business", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Dick Proctor", "party": "New Democratic Party", "date": "1997-12-09", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I too am pleased to take part in this debate this afternoon, which says the government should obtain the consent of two-thirds of the members of this House before revoking the mandate of a commission of inquiry. I want to congratulate the hon. member for Berthier\u2014Montcalm for bring the motion forward. I assure him at the outset of my support of this bill. Everyone I think knows what is behind this motion and that is the Somalia commission which the member has upper most on his mind and our minds. The Canadian peacekeeping mission to Somalia and the subsequent muzzling of the commission of inquiry by the Liberal government opposite constitute a sad and tragic episode in Canadian history. As we know now, something went horribly wrong in Somalia. Some Canadian soldiers sent there to keep the peace became the torturers and murderers of the very people they were sent to help. I know that only a very few Canadian soldiers were involved, but we cannot deny or hide under a rug what happened there. Nor can we deny the ugly strain of racism that showed itself in at least one of our regiments stationed in Somalia. This behaviour was appalling enough. What is even more shocking is the cover-up that occurred, a cover-up that included some of our senior defence personnel. I think it is worth recalling how we found out about the tortures and killings in Somalia and about the cover-up. We first learned about it through some enterprising news reporters. I congratulate members of my former profession and I would single out Michael MacAuliffe from CBC radio for bringing this unsavoury information to light in this country. We learned more when soldiers with a conscience blew the whistle as well. Throughout all this the upper echelons of the military establishment continued to stonewall and, even worse, to destroy some documents and tamper with others. We were not getting the full story on Somalia, so in 1994 the Liberal government named a commission of inquiry. Initially the Liberals were great truth seekers and democrats. One might summarize that they enjoyed having a commission of inquiry probing into events that occurred during the term of the previous Mulroney government. We all watched as the commission began its work. We watched the stonewalling and obfuscation by military brass and their attempts to avoid having the real story come out. This subterfuge and these attempts at evasion prolonged the hearings and frustrated the commissioners. The commission and its proceedings also began to frighten the Liberal government. They were now well into their term. They did not want to see the defence department's dirty linen washed in public, particularly in the run-up to the federal election of this last June. We all know what happened. In the run-up the Liberals ordered the Somalia commission shut down as of June 30. One of the three Somalia commissioners, Peter Desbarats, a former distinguished journalist and now an instructor of journalism at the University of Western Ontario, described that shutdown as \u201cone of the most brazen cover-ups and denials of responsibly in the history of this country\u201d. He also called the Liberal action a \u201cbrazen cover-up and a denial of responsibility\u201d. Because the inquiry was snuffed out we will never know exactly what happened in Somalia, and we will never really know who was responsible for the ensuing cover-up. Exchange of information is the oxygen of a free and democratic society. By shutting down the Somalia inquiry the Liberals deprived of that vital oxygen in this instance. To the best of my knowledge this is the first time ever that a federal government has shut down a commission of inquiry in mid-term. In his remarks earlier the parliamentary secretary, who had done some extensive research, talked about 350 commissions of inquiry, royal commissions, et cetera, but I did not hear him say how many had ever been shut down by the government. I think our research is correct on this. This is the first time in the history of the country that a commission of inquiry has been closed down before it finished its work. It is profoundly undemocratic and it set a very dangerous precedent for the future. I want to remind members opposite of just how valuable commissions of inquiry and royal commissions have been in the nation's history. In the 1930s, for example, the Rowell-Sirois commission looked deeply into federal-provincial relations in this country. That commission did groundbreaking work and its recommendations set the stage for a social contract that vastly improved life for millions of Canadians. This was extremely important to people in the province of Saskatchewan, where I come from, who had been ravaged by the depression. The Rowell-Sirois commission was an embarrassment to the federal government of the day because Ottawa had been sitting back and appeared content to continue to sit back and allow Canadians to suffer through that horrible depression. The royal commissioners had a very different idea and outlined it. As I said, it was an embarrassment to the government but it certainly did not move to shut down the commission. What the Liberals did in this present context in snuffing out Somalia was self-serving and undemocratic. In political terms the issues here are arrogance and accountability. The Liberals believe they were born to govern and think they can do almost anything and get away with it. They paid for this arrogance, however, in the last election. Despite pre-election polls that indicated that it was going to be a cakewalk, they only won a narrow majority and only one seat in the province of Saskatchewan. They should be asking themselves why this happened. This arrogant and unaccountable government has to be contained. It is for this reason that I support the motion of the hon. member for Berthier\u2014Montcalm which states the government should obtain the consent of two-thirds of the members of the House before revoking the mandate of an inquiry commission. I want to remark on the hon. member's choice of the 66% figure. Government appoints a royal commission or commission of inquiry for a reason. Once appointed the commission should remain free of interference and be able to complete its work. This private member's bill states that it should take more than a simple majority vote to shut a commission down. For this reason I support the 66% figure used by the hon. member. I also add parenthetically that a 66% vote would also make a good deal of sense when we talk about certain referenda in this country that could eventually break it up. For the moment I will contain my thoughts on that and simply say that I support the hon. member's motion regarding commissions of inquiry and congratulate him for bringing it forward today.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20050308-1524.9.1.70", "topic": "Emergency Debate", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Monte Solberg", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2005-03-08", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and address the emergency debate this evening with respect to the crisis in agriculture. In this case we are talking about BSE but I do want to talk for a moment about the crisis in agriculture in general. I want to thank the member for Haldimand\u2014Norfolk for her leadership on this issue. I want to thank the member for Battlefords\u2014Lloydminster for sponsoring the debate tonight. I also want to thank the member for Lethbridge whose spot I am filling tonight. He represents a riding where there are 900,000 cattle and feedlots. He is also a leader in this area. Those are big cowboy boots to fill, but I will do my best to do that tonight. I will start by pointing to the fact that the government has not taken the crisis on the farm seriously. A couple of weeks ago the finance minister stood here and delivered a budget speech on the economy. He did not even mention the fact that farmers today are facing probably the worst crisis that they have faced since the Great Depression. That is not an exaggeration. In 2003 farm incomes went negative for the first time since the 1930s. Interestingly that same year when the CAIS program came in, $1.4 billion was allocated but it still could not be triggered. Even though farmers were in this terrible income crisis, it still would not trigger payouts to all kinds of people who were losing tremendous amounts of money. I want to argue that the minister is wrong when he says that the CAIS program is working. I want to argue that this crisis affects everyone in agriculture, not just cattle producers. It is a serious problem. The best way to make the point is to read an e-mail I received today from someone in my riding. It says: This time of year when a farmer should be getting the \u201cspring fever itch\u201d, I'm getting depressed because there is no money left in any of our commodities and our expenses are going through the roof, our margins are rapidly shrinking. These are things I know you are aware of...hence why I'm sending you this e-mail. My brother and I are second generation farmers, this farm has seen many changes in the last 10 years to accommodate the growing numbers the farm has to support, and falling prices. Our debt load is at its absolute max. and with the futures on many different crops, it's not looking good.... I'm not looking for sympathy, I simply wanted to explain our situation to you to give you a little history and to bring up a few points. He goes on to say: I am 32 years old and losing hope in my career and my country very quickly. I know there is no magic cure to turn things around, but I feel as a last ditch effort you in some way carry hope for the farmers in Alberta-- He says flattering things about me which I appreciate, but there are many people in this place on all sides of the House who care deeply about farmers. In the face of all the evidence that the government is failing farmers on the CAIS program, and in terms of getting some resolution when it comes to getting the border open, I do not understand why the minister a few minutes ago stood there and defended his actions. His actions and their lack of results are indefensible. That is the point. We have an obligation and a right to stand and criticize the government when it is not doing its job. The Liberals are not doing the job for Canadian farmers today. Even though the minister does not like to hear the criticism of his department and the things that they do, we have an obligation to stand up for farmers on these issues. That is what we are going to do tonight. I want to talk for a moment about the border. Not long ago the Prime Minister, knowing that the border was due to open on March 7, because he was afraid of the debate about missile defence at the Liberal convention, went out before the convention and announced his decision not to support missile defence. In other words, for political reasons he decided he would jeopardize goodwill with the Americans, knowing the border should be opening on March 7, simply because he did not want to have to face the music at the Liberal convention. In other words, he put his concerns ahead of the concerns of Canadian ranchers and cattlemen. That is simply disgraceful and the result has been borne out. I am not going to argue that the judge in Montana took that into account, but I know those senators did when they voted to get rid of the rule that would open the border. In fact, not long ago there were some Canadian parliamentarians who went to Washington. They had a discussion with a Senator Smith from Portland. I looked at the minutes of the meeting and he absolutely tied the security issues and Canada's lack of support on security issues with the problems affecting trade in cattle and beef together. The minister and the Prime Minister can duck, dodge, dive and weave all they want but I am telling members that senators on the other side of the border are saying the two are tied together. In the United States, security trumps trade, and we are seeing it happen again in this situation. It is time for the government to wake up to that reality and to start addressing some of these concerns the Americans have about whether we are true allies in so many of these situations. They are tied together. I do not know how many times I have heard that in the last little while. When I go back home people are saying that the relationship between how we treat our American friends on these security issues and the problems in trade are tied together. Farmers and ranchers know they are connected but somehow the government seems to think there is no connection at all. I touched for a moment on the CAIS program. I just want to emphasize how frustrated farmers are with this program. It is not doing the job. We can have a situation where people have lost money every year for the five year period that the formula applies to for the CAIS program and if in the last year they lose less money than they lost the year before they will not trigger a payout. They will be losing money. However, if in four years out of five years they make money and in the last year they lose a little bit of money or make less money they will trigger a payout. It is crazy. We have a situation where people who are in dire economic straits, on the cusp of losing their farm, will not get a payout on this program. It makes absolutely no sense and yet the minister stands in this place and defends the CAIS program. Without naming names, I can look across the way and know I have heard similar criticisms coming from members on the other side. There is no question that the minister has to get his act together and straighten this out. The minister says that we are making partisan points. Well let me make an offer to the Minister of Agriculture. I know I could ask members who are sitting here today if they would be willing to work with the minister on a good faith basis to get that fixed and to get payouts to farmers in a timely way, in a way that makes sense based on their income, and I know we would be prepared to do that. We would be prepared to sit there and help get this thing fixed. We are here to make a difference. We want to make this minority Parliament work and if we can make a difference, and the minister is willing to do that, we would be thrilled to do it. However the minister claims that the program is not broken. He claims that it is working fine. We cannot start on a basis where the minister will not admit that there are serious problems in the program. I want to talk for a moment about what I think is a fundamental shortcoming of the government: the need to increase packing capacity. I know there has been some additional capacity but we are talking about almost two years now since the border closed and we still are way behind the curve in terms of getting more animals slaughtered. The only way we can get cattle south of the border now is to send muscle cuts, boxed beef, into the U.S. We need to get more packing capacity. This loan loss program is just a joke. We would be prepared to work with the government if it were willing to work with us to make more money available so that we can get more slaughter capacity. However we need to see some admission from the government that the current situation is not working but it does not seem to be willing to admit that. I think I heard the minister say something positive about the possibility of a cull program. Over a year ago the member for Battlefords\u2014Lloydminster argued that we should be doing that and we have advocated that position ever since. If the government is considering doing that we would certainly support it.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20060921-210.6.1.15", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "R\u00e9al M\u00e9nard", "party": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "date": "2006-09-21", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-12 . This is a moment I have been eagerly awaiting, for I am well aware that in the world in which we now live, the issue of emergencies certainly demands the attention of legislators. Just earlier, I was pondering the fact that, even in the 1800s, people were trying to regulate emergencies with the Quarantine Act. Why did they attempt to use this act in part to regulate emergencies? Because disease was surely the greatest threat to human communities, to the human condition about which Malraux spoke to us with such talent. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you are an enthusiast of Malraux. I know your erudition, and even your epicurean side. Of course, if we are talking about the 16th, 17th or 18th centuries, the spread of disease could not possibly be compared with the SARS crisis that we experienced, for example. And for once, the federal government was in a field of jurisdiction that belonged to it alone, under a class of subject enumerated in the Constitution. When we speak of emergencies, the word \u201cemergency\u201d is in itself open to many meanings. What does it mean when we speak of emergencies? Are we talking about disease, the unleashed forces of nature, public transit, natural catastrophes, the overflowing of the Red River, the pollution in the big cities, terrorist attacks? Terrorism is a real fact of our collective life. If I may digress, for a parliament and a parliamentarian, the end can never justify the means. One can never say, on account of some context one considers extraordinary, that one is going to take certain actions prejudicial to personal freedoms. In any case, you know how the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is. If there is one party in this House that could hold a set of scales in its hands, with a centre of gravity that can balance human rights with necessary protection of the community, that party is surely the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. How could we not be disturbed by Bill C-24 , and its successor Bill C-36 on anti-terrorist measures. The government was trying to plagiarize the previous government, and it plagiarized certain provisions of the Patriot Act, tabled by the Bush administration. Incidentally, it will be with great interest that we shall read the judgment to be rendered shortly on the security certificates. I know that some of my caucus colleagues, and in particular our immigration and public safety critics, have a lot of reasons to be worried. I would ask you the question, Mr. Speaker. Is it acceptable, in a country that adheres to the rule of law, for a person to be subject to arrest without warrant, arbitrarily detained, and not have access to the complete evidence in his or her court file? Do we not learn in our law schools that it is important to have a just and fair trial? Are we not in the post-Stinchcombe era? The Supreme Court has given judgment on this point. My colleague from Marc-Aur\u00e8le-Fortin is aware of that. Stinchcombe requires that all evidence be disclosed. That is surprising, because Stinchcombe involved a tax fraud matter, if I recall correctly. In any case emergencies cover a range of situations: SARS, overflowing rivers, terrorism, or mass transit. We know that in some democracies, the evil hand of certain groups has used mass transit to spread toxic substances. Plainly it is a concern of governments, I would even say their duty, to have evacuation and emergency plans. Let us ask the question: is this primarily the responsibility of the federal government? That question arises in the case before us. This is not a case involving quarantine, an epidemic or virology. The bill says: This enactment provides for a national emergency management system that strengthens Canada\u2019s capacity to protect Canadians. Obviously, when we read the bill, we can say that it is reasonable for the federal government, in the departments for which that government is responsible, to have an emergency plan. We therefore understand that it is reasonable for there to be a plan for public safety, health, national defence, or any other example that my colleagues may bring to my attention. Closer to home, I know that on Parliament Hill, the Board of Internal Economy, of which the various party whips are members, thinks about how to ensure that the Hill is safer. There have been very few unfortunate incidents, but still, there have been a few. In fact, there is a new Sergeant-at-Arms in the House. I would like to wish him success in the responsibilities of his position. He is the person who is responsible for the safety of parliamentarians. In the British parliamentary tradition, the distance between the opposition and the government is two and a half sword lengths. Why? Because when Parliament was first created, when the institution of Parliament was created in the United Kingdom, the monarch stood in fear of members of Parliament. That is the source of the tradition, when the Speaker is elected, of dragging him or her by the arm while being met with resistance. That is because some of the speakers, in some of the Parliaments of Great Britain, who were called burgesses, were beheaded when the king did not agree with them. So as not to wander too far afield, let us come back to the Sergeant-at-Arms. He is responsible for parliamentarians\u2019 safety, and in emergencies he must arrange for the Hill to be evacuated. I would like to give you an example of a traumatic event that I experienced personally. Every member of this House is familiar with my sturdiness, physical strength and self-discipline. Then there is the President of the United States, who thinks he is the master of any house he happens to be in. When President Bush visited the Hill, some parliamentarians, including me, were not allowed access to the Hill. My colleague from Saint-Lambert was also denied access to the Hill. Why? Not because the constables prevented us from entering. After all, their kindness is known to us all. They were not the ones who denied us entry. It was security personnel outside Parliament who stopped us; they went about it quite rudely, I might add. Such events prompt us to think about how we might react in an emergency that forced us to evacuate the building rapidly. I know that Board of Internal Economy members, including the whips, have discussed this issue. So, yes, we have to have emergency measures in place in our large communities, especially in big cities. Emergencies can be caused by natural disasters, terrorist attacks on public transportation or, of course, disease. Obviously, we do not deal with disease as we did in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, but imagine the impact of a virus spreading through our communities. Even in our modern society, we have come to realize that hospitals are not always a safe haven. We do not think that going to the hospital can make us sick. I feel comfortable talking about this before the member for Qu\u00e9bec because I know she is as healthy as a horse, but people sure do not expect to get sick when they go to the hospital. We recently learned that some hospitals in Canada were vectors of contamination. This is one of the emergencies for which we must plan. Although the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois agrees with this bill in principle, we have some concerns. First is the issue of respecting provincial responsibilities. A national emergency should never mean there is just one government. We are long past the time of the Rowell-Sirois commission. We are not in an apprehended war situation. As elected members of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, as representatives of the people of Quebec, we must never act as though there were just one government. The National Assembly, whose first speaker was Mr. Panet\u2014if I recall correctly\u2014is one of the oldest Parliaments in North America. A number of years ago, it passed its own public safety plan. And who was the author of this important plan that respects decentralization, a plan whose goal was to have the regional county municipalities, the municipalities and the health care system work together? When we think of emergencies, these are the players we want to see promote a common vision. The National Assembly was the first francophone Parliament in North America. It was led by Speaker Panet and founded under the Constitutional Act, 1791, with ministerial responsibility introduced in 1848. It used to be referred to as the Salon de la race, but that expression is no longer used. It passed its public safety plan. We are most privileged to have among us the author of the plan, none other than the hon. member for Marc-Aur\u00e8le-Fortin , who was the public safety minister at the time and who served the Government of Quebec well.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20091008-2195.6.1.28", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Peter Julian", "party": "New Democratic Party", "date": "2009-10-08", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand and talk about these kinds of issues. In this corner of the House, the NDP takes no lessons from federal Conservatives about defending western Canadians and western Canadian farmers. In fact, in a very real sense, by putting forward this hoist motion, what we are doing, inadvertently, is saving the Conservatives from the themselves because they have taken for granted the support of western farmers over the last few years. The Conservatives said that when they became government they would move forward with an agenda that would actually help western farmers. Instead, it is fair to say that the reason more and more New Democrats are being elected in western Canada is because western Canadian farmers are seeing that the Conservative agenda has been very ideological and meanspirited. Let us look at the record. Since they have come to power, farm receipts now for western Canadian farmers are at the lowest level since the Great Depression. In fact, many farmers in rural communities across western Canada are actually in a negative income situation. We are looking at the highest level of debt for farmers than we have seen since the Great Depression, in real terms of course. It is important to note that the lowest level of farm receipts in the entire country is in the province of Alberta, which has been dominated by provincial Conservatives for the last 30 years. So what is wrong with this picture? In places like British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba where New Democrats have come to power and had positive, forward looking policies that actually helped western farmers, we have seen that the income crash has not been nearly as significant. Of course farmers in Manitoba are doing the best of all, but in Alberta, where the Conservatives have been in power, farm receipts are the lowest in the country. There is strike one against the Conservatives on how they managed the agricultural file. Strike two was their meanspirited and ideological attack on the Canadian Wheat Board. What they liked to say was that they would tell farmers in the west what to think and they would tell farmers what they think. What happened? Western farmers had a chance to vote on the Conservative proposals. There was a straight slate of rabid Conservatives just waiting to dismantle the Wheat Board. They could hardly wait to rip up the Wheat Board, attack the institution, and western farmers overwhelmingly voted for a pro Wheat Board slate and pushed the Conservatives back. That was strike two for Conservatives in western Canada. Now we have strike three. Even before we talk about Bill C-13 , we see that they are not standing up for supply management. I mentioned earlier the whole issue of western farm receipts, that they are at the lowest level since the Great Depression, particularly low where Conservatives are governing because they do not seem to understand agricultural issues or perhaps it is their own ideological bent that means that they mess up the agricultural file. Supply management and the Wheat Board are now going forward in WTO negotiations. Have they said unequivocally that supply management and the Wheat Board are not on the table? No. We heard today, in fact, that they have missed every opportunity to stand up for supply management, every opportunity to strike back on the working group, that fifth paper that undermines supply management and the Wheat Board. New Zealand was able to get its state trading corporation excluded and the Conservative government was not able to do that.

I would like to begin by thanking the people of Argenteuil\u2014Papineau\u2014Mirabel for once again entrusting me with the task of representing them here in the House of Commons, with a majority of just over 15,000 votes. I extend my warmest thanks to them. Obviously, I believe I am entitled to speak on their behalf, like any member of any party in this House. Even though ours is a sovereigntist party, it has always respected democracy and our position within Parliament. We have always respected the way Parliament works and the Constitution that still binds us to Canada and will continue to bind us until we have our own country, something we will achieve legally and democratically. Today, we are talking about an economic statement that is part of the democratic process in Canada. There was a Speech from the Throne, and the Minister of Finance had the job of giving this economic statement. The government had to make choices. In an economic statement, the government can simply describe the economic situation, or it can announce new programs and new investments. The Conservative government made a choice. In the midst of an economic crisis, it chose not to take the bull by the horns and not to attack the economic crisis directly. That is why the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is the only party that proposed an investment plan\u2014worth $23 billion\u2014and it has never hidden that fact. We made these proposals in light of what was happening with the global economy. The European Union tabled a $200 billion development and investment plan. The United States tabled an $800 billion development and investment plan. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois proposed a $23 billion plan, which the Government of Canada can afford. We never hid that fact. This plan was meant to help the poorest members of our society, people who have lost their jobs, seniors, women, people in need, as well as businesses. I will describe this plan during my speech. Our goal was to deal with the crisis, which the Prime Minister had referred to when he called the election. Why did he go against his own fixed election date legislation, which would have had us going to the polls in October 2009? Because there was a global economic crisis. The problem, as we saw during the election campaign, is that the Conservative ideology will always be there. There has been no solution to the problem of the forestry and manufacturing crisis, which started well before the monetary crisis we are seeing today. The free market was given free rein. That is what the economic statement is proposing once again: laissez-faire, once more. The economic statement plans to deregulate investments. One of the measures in this economic statement would allow foreign companies to buy Canadian businesses. They want to give the market free rein, and they say it will regulate itself. Well that will not happen, and that is the tragedy. The other countries in the world have understood this, and that is why Europe has invested $200 billion, and the Americans have invested $800 billion. Those are the facts of the matter. Right-wing Conservative ideology has seen its day. That is why the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cannot support a government that does not understand the problems people are experiencing. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs are there on the ground. The men and women who are my colleagues, who were elected in the last election campaign, know this, because every day and every weekend they are there talking to the people. We know the tragedy that is happening in the forestry and manufacturing regions. We keep on top of the current economic crisis that is preventing our constituents from buying what they would like to buy for Christmas. We understand this. We are therefore in a better position than a lot of others are to say in this House that we have to invest in concrete measures. The reason the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cannot support the statement is quite simply because the Conservative government has presented an ideological right-wing statement. We are considering the best interests of the Quebec nation. What that nation wants right now is for the economic crisis to be resolved the way the other countries in the world are doing. That is quite simply it. That is why yesterday you surely saw, as we did, that three opposition parties signed an agreement to deny this government any further legitimacy. The Canadian federalist system is governed by English law. When the government no longer has the confidence of the House, it cannot continue to govern. Those are the facts. The Conservatives can rant on in this House until they are blue in the face, but their economic statement was not up to the task, and yesterday, with the stroke of a pen, the opposition parties decided to try to form a coalition government, as the Canadian constitution allows them to do. In my opinion, it will be much more effective at tackling the economic crisis than the present government. So the facts of the matter are simple. The Governor General will have to settle it, because as of yesterday this Conservative government no longer has a legitimate claim to govern. It is as simple as that, and that is how it is. That is how democracy, how British parliamentarianism, says it is. That is why the sovereignists in the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, in the best interests of the Quebec nation, have allied with the Liberal and New Democratic federalists. The Conservative Party can call us all the names it likes, but the fact remains that they are still federasts. The Conservatives decided to do what suited them, flying in the face of the entire British parliamentary system. The Prime Minister should ask the Governor General today to turn the government over to the coalition formed yesterday. That is the reality. The Conservatives will go to any lengths over the next few days to keep trying to persuade us that they are right. They should have tabled an economic statement that was respectful of the public will. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois had extended its hand. We submitted a program proposing $23 billion in investments. The finance minister congratulated us on it and thanked us, but there was no sign of it in the economic statement. We worked hard, therefore, to try to deal with the situation, to extend our hand with a plan for $23 billion in investments to counter the economic crisis, as they are doing in Europe and the United States. But the Conservative Party decided to ignore these desires. That was its choice, but now it should respect the democratic choice, and very simply, under the British parliamentary system, a government that no longer enjoys the confidence of the House cannot continue in office. That is the reality. It does not have anything to do with the popular vote. The popular vote elects representatives to sit in this House, and these representatives must have confidence in the government. As of yesterday, they no longer have that confidence. Why? Because the economic statement we are discussing today does not reflect what the majority of the people represented by us, the members of this House in all the political parties. We want to resolve the economic crisis quickly. We just want to deal with it. The right-wing Conservative ideology is laissez-faire\u2014just let the economy take its course and clean up the mess afterwards. That is not a solution, and it is not the approach that other countries in the world have taken to deal with this unprecedented crisis. We have not seen anything like it since the Great Depression of the 1920s. That is the reality. We are facing a new situation. No two economic crises are ever the same. This is a new approach and it is the one that the governments of the world have decided to take in order to tackle this crisis. They are going to inject cash into their economies to try to get through the recession. If we had done the same for the forestry sector, we would not be talking about a crisis there today. It would have been taken care of. The Conservatives decided not to deal with the crisis in forestry, and it is just piled up now on top of the banking crisis, the credit crisis, and so forth. We are going from crisis to crisis. We are making the problem bigger and nothing will get done under this government. It is finished. The Conservatives should realize this and give the opposition a chance. It is not easy to tackle an economic crisis and decide as a party to form a coalition in the House of Commons with other parties in order to get through the crisis and try to deal with the fate of the weakest and most deprived members of our society. That is not easy. The Conservatives decided to do nothing, and that is their prerogative. But let them stand aside and allow the coalition to do it because we believe that in a wealthy country like Canada we will be able to overcome this crisis and help the weakest, most vulnerable members of our society. That ideological choice was not just laissez-faire economics. The Conservatives also decided to attack workers' rights by suspending the right to strike and to pay equity. They used the economic crisis to deal with some ideological issues that are dear to activists' hearts. Conservative members will no doubt have plenty of letters and emails to show us. Naturally. There is a right-wing economics movement that wants to suspend workers' rights, send women back home, suspend women's rights in the workplace, and so on. That is an ideological choice, but it is not the choice that the majority of Canadians made. The Conservative members have to accept that. We believe that we have every right to rise in this House, because Quebec pays its share of sales and income taxes to the federal government. My background is in municipal affairs. I was president of the Union des municipalit\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec from 1997 to 2000, and I was a mayor for 17 years. In our geopolitical context, there are three levels of government: municipal, provincial and federal. I always feel disillusioned when I see that the federal government\u2014which has the most money because it gets over 50% of all income and sales taxes collected in Canada\u2014does not do anything about health care because the provinces are responsible for health care. It does nothing about education because the provinces are responsible for education. It does nothing about transportation. It looks after a few bridges, but does nothing about the roads because, for the most part, structures and infrastructure are under provincial or municipal jurisdiction. One might expect the federal government to implement this program because it collects most of the sales and income taxes. One might also expect the federal government to transfer money into a major program to help maintain infrastructure managed by other levels of government. But seeing how the Department of Canadian Heritage maintains its own heritage buildings, it is clear that the government cannot even look after its own buildings. One might expect the federal government to participate in the management of buildings administered by the provinces, because it collects most of the taxes. That is the kind of thing the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is calling for. The Bloc is calling for investments in infrastructure to be accelerated and for gas tax transfers for infrastructure to be increased from 3\u00a2 to 5\u00a2 right away, rather than in 2010. Most economists support this kind of one-off assistance. Investment in infrastructure is one way to help address the economic crisis. It would give people jobs, upgrade buildings and get our workers back to work in order to help the economy. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois also proposed eliminating the two week waiting period in the employment insurance program, a program that has been paid for entirely by employers and employees since 1996. The federal government does not contribute a single cent. Once again, while this economic crisis is causing people to lose their jobs, the people affected need their money right away, especially since the holiday season is just around the corner. Yet they continue to be penalized by the two week waiting period. The minister rose in this House to tell us that it was standard practice, since private insurance also has a waiting period. But when you think about it, employment insurance is paid for entirely by employers and employees. Furthermore, if employers and employees were asked if they would like to see the waiting period eliminated, they would immediately agree. Even employers that must shut down parts of their businesses could not oppose the idea of their employees receiving their benefits immediately, instead of having to face two weeks with no income. Losing one's job can cause family problems. This is a minor request that would not cost the government very much, but it was denied. The same goes for a program for older worker adjustment, which would provide workers aged 55 and older who lose their jobs with a basic income until they receive their pension. It would also bridge the salary gap for workers who find work that does not pay as well, until they reach the age of 65. This measure would cost $45 million, but was rejected by the Conservative government. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been proposing many things to help the least fortunate in our society, but these suggestions have all been rejected by the Conservative Party with its right-wing ideology. The Conservatives are attacking workers' rights at a time when the unemployment rate in Alberta is 3%. That amounts to full employment and there is even a shortage of workers. In Alberta, employers are forced to offer higher wages if they hope to find employees. That may be normal there but it is not the case in the rest of Canada. The navel-gazing must stop. The Conservative Party must stop viewing Alberta as the centre of the universe. They have to be able to see what is happening throughout Canada. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has always been open-minded in its work in Parliament. We are sensitive to the fate of men and women who have paid and continue to pay taxes, to those who are losing their jobs and need assistance, to the manufacturing and forestry sectors that are in trouble and need help getting through the crisis. Over the past five years, the mining sector also went through tough times, but it recovered. The economy is cyclical. We all know that. The way to help a sector is to support it in times of crisis until the economy recovers. Then we can help another sector. That is how it is. That is why governments are elected. The Conservative government came to power. It is a minority government and it knows very well that to have the confidence of the House it must at least have the support of a majority of members. It must therefore obtain the support of another political party and propose measures acceptable to the opponents it faced in the last election. That is the fact of the matter. If the Conservatives do not accept it, that is a political choice. They are, moreover, dealing today with the result: the agreement signed yesterday by the opposition parties. The specific purpose of that agreement is to have a new government, one that will be far more open\u2014a left-of-centre government\u2014in compensation for the recent years of right-of-centre economics that have prevailed in Canada. Incidentally, that is not the approach that has been adopted by other countries in the world. Europe has decided to be left of centre, as have the Americans. It is a choice. An unprecedented crisis is looming all over the world. We need a government that listens to the public, and listens to business, in order to try to solve the problems. We must not just wait for them to solve themselves. That is the reality. This is a democratic choice that must be respected by the Conservative members of this House. The British parliamentary system requires the Governor General to be the one to settle this, and in my opinion, the sooner, the better. I have been saying this right from the start. Since yesterday, since the very moment that the three opposition parties signed the agreement for a coalition government, that party has no more legitimacy in this House. It must go to the Governor General. Doing anything else would just be an attempt to buy some time and stay in power. According to the rules of the British parliamentary system, for a government to govern it must have the confidence of this House. When that historic agreement was signed, that confidence was lost. That leads me back to the economic statement. The entire situation has arisen out of the fact that the Prime Minister and his Minister of Finance lacked judgment. The main conclusion history will reach from this is that we had a Prime Minister and a Minister of Finance who, for purely partisan reasons, and because they believed that the Liberals were not just on their knees but totally down and out, decided to just steamroller over them. They found out that the Liberal Party still had a backbone. They are also well aware that the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has always had a backbone. In fact, that is why we are so strong here. Quebeckers elected a majority of members from the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, because this party stands tall. We will never be afraid of anyone, anywhere, anytime. We will defend the rights of Quebeckers in this Parliament as long as we pay taxes to Ottawa. We are not afraid to do so, and we never will be. We have always respected democracy in this Parliament, and we will continue to do so as long as we are here. Obviously, we will support this coalition government until June 2010. We are in the midst of an economic crisis, and it is in the best interests of the Quebec nation that we take action to deal with this economic crisis for the sake of the men and women who have lost their jobs, who could lose their jobs or who could have financial problems. We must do what all the other countries of the world are doing. The European Union has invested $200 billion, and the United States, $800 billion. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois proposed injecting $23 billion into the economy. That is what is needed. This is no time to be dogmatic and embrace a right-wing ideology. Yet the Conservatives are doing just that and are determined to take a laissez-faire approach to this crisis. That did not work for the forestry crisis, which still exists. Now, the automotive industry is in an unprecedented crisis caused by a credit crunch.

At the heart of the motion is the fact that, under the Conservative government, a long-standing relationship with the United States has been deteriorating, not just slowly but rapidly deteriorating. We are a trading nation. Canada depends for 45% of its gross domestic product on trade, 80% of that trade is carried out with the United States, our neighbour to the south. That country has been our ally. We have disagreed, but we have always had a strong relationship. By a strong relationship, I do not mean that we stand there and pound our fists. I mean it is a relationship based on mutual respect. To create a relationship, we need to have ongoing and open lines of communication. We have to keep the relationship going. We have to continue talking. We have to continue building on the things that we share and stand firm on the things that we do not share. That was the nature of the relationship, at least under the Liberal government, for 13 years before the Conservative government came into power. The problem is that relationship no longer exists. The current relationship between Canada and the United States is typified by two descriptors: one is fawning or subservient and the other is reactive. The government either reacts to something that it obviously is not aware is coming down the pipe, or it bows its head and meekly does what it is told to do, at times when it needs to, and I will elaborate on these a little later. However, I want to talk a little about the fact that the reactivity is what is of great concern to us. If we have open lines of communication and if we maintain a strong relationship, we are friends. We talk to each other. We do not necessarily agree, but at least we know what is coming down the pipe. Even if we were not forewarned in certain conversations that we kept between us as two sovereign nations, one should just look at history and tradition. During the Great Depression, and in the dirty thirties as it was called, we saw how the United States reacted at that time to a depression. It began to be protectionist. This is the nature of any country, when it is faced with stress, to behave in certain patterns. We should have known those patterns. The reaction to stress by the United States is to immediately crawl in and become protectionist. Therefore, we should have seen it coming down the pipe for two reasons: first, because of tradition and history under stress; and second, because we also had lines of communication open. Therefore, the government has a failing mark on both of those, on reading the history or on being able to have open lines of communication. Now what we have is reactivity. Thank goodness for a new president whose administration is one that has decided that it would rather make friends and do the right thing, rather than continue to be strong and pound the table along with other people. We have seen this happen. President Obama said that he did not want to harm trade relationships with the world. Worldwide trade relationships will be harmed if the Americans resort to protectionism. We saw that happen after the Great Depression when the world trading relationships began to fall apart after the protectionism by the United States. Here we have something that we could have headed off at the pass without needing to have the President of the United States to turn around and say, \u201cOops, I'm sorry\u201d. We could have headed that off. In good relationships we do not paint our friends in a corner and have them having to bow out and say, \u201cI'm sorry, I didn't think about that earlier on\u201d. However, what does it say, when we, as the nearest neighbour, supposedly a country with strong relationships, allies sharing the longest unprotected border in the world, did not know that we were on the agenda. It means we are not even on the radar with the United States. We used to be on the radar. A good example was when President Clinton came to visit. He came to the House. He spoke to the House. He spoke to the senate. We welcomed him. President Bush came here. He also came and spoke to everyone and was welcomed. We differ on certain occasions, but we maintain that friendship and the ability to lobby and to talk to each other. It is not by chance that members of Parliament are able to use their flying points to go to Washington, D.C. because we must continue to keep those lines open. The government has failed on that. The lines are closed. No one knows what is happening. The result, as we have seen with the recession, was too little too late. The government pretends things are not happening. It is always in denial. When things fall apart at the seams, government members suddenly leap into the air yelling and screaming and wonder what to do next. That is the pattern of the Conservative government. We should not have been surprised that this occurred. I want to also talk about the other part of the relationship which we seem to have developed with the United States. It is not one of a strong partner with mutual respect for each other. It is a subservient kind of relationship, and I go back to the softwood lumber deal because it is something that we must bring to the table as an example of how we are either reactive or subservient. The relationship between the two countries has always been based on mutual respect and a strong sense that we understood each other. Canada would do what it thought was best and the United States would do what it thought was best, but we totally respected each other. That is gone. The Liberals made a strong deal with the United States when we negotiated an agreement on softwood lumber. The Conservative government came into power and agreed to a deal that left $1 billion, on the table, money that the Liberal government had negotiated, to go back to the U.S. The Conservatives also made an agreement that increased the tariffs under certain conditions. It was a bad deal. A legal analysis commissioned by the Free Trade Lumber Council and two Ontario associations had this to say, \u201cWe are sharply critical of the April 27th package which is a political bargain forsaking entirely the rule of law enshrined in the North American free trade agreement. It was something that was a political deal brokered between the administration of [the Prime Minister] and George Bush\u201d. Political deals were made that were not in the best interests of Canada at all. We lost a great deal at the table. Here is what we also heard from people in the mill industry in British Columbia: They had phone calls at the mill level from Conservative MPs and they were told very clearly, \u201cIf you don't support this, don't count on the federal government for helping you with your difficulties later on\u201d. We had a political deal based on subservience, brokered just to allow for good relationships to continue. I used to be a negotiator for doctors in the province of British Columbia. One cannot negotiate from a position of weakness, but must negotiate from a position of strength. There has to be mutual respect at the table if a deal is going to be brokered that is a win-win situation on both sides. Now we see a new administration in the United States, an administration that seems to be a polar opposite to the current Conservative government. It is sad because there seems to be little in common. The President of the United States believes in science. He listens to what others tell him. He is not ideological. He is bringing back things like stem cell research and talking about funding groups that are non-advocates and do not necessarily agree with him, but funding them nonetheless. He is going back to dealing with things based on knowledge and information and outcomes and what works. The Conservative government is based on ideology and ideology alone. I worry for our future relationship with the United States. I worry that this deteriorating relationship is going to slide downhill very rapidly when the intelligent and modern day thinking President of the United States listens to what we have here, which is a retrogressive, ideological government. He can find nothing in common with us. I hope for the sake of Canadians and all our industries that this never happens.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20111019-2401.5.1.3", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "government", "speaker": "Gerry Ritz", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2011-10-19", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Madam Speaker, we are just so darned proud of him but I will say the Prime Minister. We believe that all Canadian farmers should be able to position their businesses to capture the marketing opportunities that will be open to them. We live in a free country and giving farmers the freedom to choose is the right thing to do. Currently, by law, western Canadian wheat, durum and barley growers do not have the same rights as other producers in Canada about where and how they sell their products. For export or domestic human consumption, they have no other option but to market through the Canadian Wheat Board, the monopoly that was established in 1943 by an order in council, not by producers or for producers at that time. By allowing marketing freedom, western wheat and barley growers will be able to market based on what is best for their own bottom line of their own business. In the June 2011 Speech from the Throne, we again stated our commitment to ensure that western farmers would have the freedom to sell wheat and barley on the open market. With this proposed legislation, we would provide marketing choice to western grain farmers once and for all. To avoid market disruption, the goal is for farmers and grain marketers, including the new entity, to be able to start forward contracting in January 2012. Farmers, grain companies and customers need this assurance. As we well know, market certainty and clarity underpins stability in the marketplace domestically and internationally. The bill would remove the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board and allow for the new Canadian wheat board to continue as a voluntary marketing organization for up to five years as it makes the transition to full private entity. During the transition period, this new voluntary organization would still be called the Canadian wheat board. It would continue to offer farmers the option of pooling their crops. It would continue to benefit from a borrowing guarantee backed by the federal government and it would develop a business plan for privatization, which will be reviewed no later than 2016. This new freedom is not only good for farmers, it also has many economic benefits for communities across western Canada. New processing plants would be able to open their doors for business and look to hire new employees unfettered by the current ridiculous requirement to buy wheat and barley only from the Canadian Wheat Board. Canada's grain industry is a powerhouse that brings $16 billion to the farm gate and makes up almost half of our agricultural exports. What was once Canada's signature crop, hard red spring wheat, has fallen behind. Wheat and barley innovation has become stagnate. Competition for acres has weakened and newer crops, such as canola, have surpassed wheat in value. A C.D. Howe report released this past spring confirmed that Canada's share of annual worldwide wheat production has fallen by 50% in the last 50 years. It is a staggering number. Equally, Canadian market share and world barley exports have declined by 40% since the 1980s. With the reduced market share, the Canadian Wheat Board has less influence on the world stage and, as a result, has become a price taker. We have seen tremendous growth in value added opportunities across the Prairies over the past 20 years for crops that do not have a monopoly marketer, including oats, pulses, flax and, of course, canola. We would see these same opportunities open up for wheat and barley as we implement market freedom. We will work with farmers and industry to attract investment, encourage innovation, create value added jobs and build an overall stronger economy. Our government has promised western Canadian wheat and barley growers that they will be given marketing freedom. We are fulfilling that commitment and ensuring that the market is finally controlled by the experts in the grain industry, our farmers. The Canadian Wheat Board was first imposed on western Canadian farmers when times were different, to say the very least, difficult. Canadians had just gone through the Great Depression, World War II was raging and Canada was committed to supplying wheat to Britain. It was 1943 when farmers were forced to sell through the board. It was done with the aim of aiding the war effort, not with any pretense that it would be good for farmers. So what has changed since then? Just about everything down on the farm. For starters, it is now 2011, not 1943. Our government remains focused on economic stability and creating the right conditions for more long-term jobs and stronger economic growth, all the while steadily eliminating the deficit and returning to surplus. Our workforce is healthy and our agricultural industry is helping to drive our economy. Unfortunately, the one thing that has not changed is that prairie farmers are still forced by law to sell their wheat, durum and barley through the Canadian Wheat Board. The government's position is clear: our long-standing commitment that we are now delivering on is to promise and provide marketing choice. This is why we want to continue to have the Canadian Wheat Board in place as a choice for those who want to continue marketing through the board. For too long, barley and durum processors have been setting up shop south of the border because they could not take the red tape here in Canada. Those who are looking for an economic analysis need only listen to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce when it says: The current single-desk model restricts valued added investment in wheat and barley, significantly detracting the ability of farmers and industry to respond to market demands and earn a premium return in recognition of the innovation provided, including innovation in value-added processing. That is quite a statement. Look at what happened to oats when it came out from under the monopoly. In Manitoba alone the acreage of oats has increased by over 250,000 acres since its removal from the Wheat Board's control. This has allowed for the opening and expansion of Can-oat, a processing mill in Portage La Prairie. A half a million tonnes a year of oats run through that facility. These are the types of value-added industries and jobs that exist when farmers have the option to market their products as they so choose. The transition to marketing freedom will have an impact on the Port of Churchill, since the CWB was responsible for nearly 90% of all goods shipped through the port in 2010. Our government is taking concrete steps to help ensure the Port of Churchill will remain a viable option for exports. The Government of Canada remains committed to Churchill, and we understand the importance of economic development and diversification to the community, the region and the overall north. The government also acknowledges that the changes to the Canadian Wheat Board, while giving farmers marketing freedom, will also lead to a period of adjustment for Churchill and the surrounding region. That is why we are taking necessary steps to support the community and the port through this transition. The government will provide an economic incentive of up to $5 million per year during the five year transition period to support shipments of grain, including now oil seeds, pulses and special crops through the port. Working with the port owner, Transport Canada will invest more than $4 million to repair the existing port assets and support the safe docking of vessels. This will also enable the port to remain in sound operating condition to take advantage of future business opportunities, and could create jobs resulting in economic benefits to the community over the next three years. Western Economic Diversification Canada will work with the Churchill Gateway Development Corporation on port infrastructure improvements, and extend the project completion date an additional two years, from 2013 to 2015. Additionally, the government will continue to explore initiatives to support the ongoing operations of the port. We recognize that this is a major change for agriculture in western Canada. That is why we have been consulting extensively with stakeholders from across the supply chain, from the farm gate to seaport. Over the summer, a working group comprising experts in the field heard a broad range of advice on how the grain marketing and transportation system could transition from the current CWB-run system to an open market that includes voluntary marketing pools. The working group's report covers a wide range of issues from transportation to research to elevators, basically the how of moving to an open market. The basic thrust is to let markets work, but monitor them to ensure that effective competition prevails. The working group is one of many ways the government is seeking advice on how to move forward. One of its recommendation deals with the issue of the advance payments program. This is a very popular tool farmers use to maintain their cash flow during the production season. The APP has always been delivered on behalf of Agriculture Canada by delivery agents. In order for the new CWB to focus 100% on the marketing of grain for those farmers who choose to use it, the Canadian Canola Grower Association will now administer the APP for wheat and barley, starting with the spring 2012 advance program. Canadian canola growers have great expertise and 30 years experience in administering these cash advances. As a result of the change, many farmers will have their administrative burden reduced as they deal with fewer organizations, not to mention a potential reduction in their administration fee. Wheat and barley farmers will continue to have access to this program without disruption. Canada's wheat and barley producers constantly adapt their operations to the evolving economic and weather realities, and their ability to secure cash flows is an essential part of their ongoing business decisions. Our government is taking clear and concise action so that wheat and barley farmers will continue to have access to the advance payments program during and after this transition to an open market. With regard to the issue of producer cars, the reality is that the board's monopoly has never provided producer cars. The right to producer cars is set out in the Canada Grain Act, and producer cars have always been allocated by the Canadian Grain Commission, and the Wheat Board's only role was to charge a fee for the use of a producer car. Our government will continue to protect farmers' access to them. Similarly, the fact is that short line railways and farmer-owned inland terminals succeed in their businesses on the basis of their management skills and the value they offer producers. They will continue to offer savings to farmers without the CWB monopoly. To suggest that they depend on a monopoly, forcing farmers to deal with them, is an insult to the people who operate these businesses. These same groups offer professional and economically beneficial services to producers for non-board crops now, and they are doing very well at it. The government is committed to improving rail service for agricultural shippers. The government completed the rail service review and we announced our follow-up actions in the spring of last year. As for jobs, while the board will see some job losses initially, the future for employment in the grains sectors looks bright. We can expect more processors to start up new businesses in western Canada. Private marketers of wheat and barley will expand their workforces. The Western Grain Elevator Association members are already calling for and interviewing people to handle the increase it expects. Some have even committed to numbers that they will require in this new free setting. Milling firms will be able to purchase directly from the farmer of their choice at a price and a timeframe they negotiate. Entrepreneurs will have the option of starting up their own specialty flour mills, malting and pasta plants. In fact, just recently, we had the honour of turning the sod on a new pasta plant in Regina. Murad Al-Katib of Alliance Grain Traders, born and raised in Davidson, Saskatchewan, has been selling Canadian pulses worldwide. The company also manufactures pasta in Turkey, but has stayed out of the Canadian market because of the monopoly and all the red tape involved in dealing directly with durum producers. This is a $50 million private sector investment that will create 60 permanent jobs and 200 construction jobs. He is unequivocal in saying that this would not happen without these changes. That is great news for Saskatchewan and it is great news for farmers overall. I know that there are more to come. My colleagues on the opposite side of the floor unfortunately remain steadfast against these opportunities of an open market. Even more amazing about this opposition is that only a tiny fraction of their members represent anyone in the Wheat Board area. All of them are from city ridings. The official agriculture critics, both from Ontario, seem to think that they have the right to tell western grain farmers that they do not have the right to market their own wheat and barley as their own constituents do. In the Ontario example, we made the announcement yesterday at Don Kenny of Blondehead Farms. He is the chair of the Ontario grain producers. We also had in attendance, Barry Senft, who is the president and CEO of the Ontario wheat board. They both recommend this change. They did it in 2003 and have never looked back. My colleagues understand we are turning a page in our nation's great history and we will all be better for it. Exciting new opportunities lie ahead for our grain industry. The government is pleased to receive the support of this initiative from three of the four provinces shackled by the monopoly. Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia produce over 90% of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley. The agriculture minister from Saskatchewan said: Saskatchewan farmers spend their own hard-earned money on land, machinery and inputs to grow their own crops, so why shouldn't they have the marketing freedom to decide how, when, and to whom they sell their grain? Alberta's agriculture and rural development minister said: Marketing opportunities are being lost every day and it's vital that Alberta's grain producers be able to market their product to anyone they choose. As well, the agriculture minister for British Columbia said: Every farmer in Western Canada deserves the right to sell their grain when, to whom and for the price that works best for their farm business. The government is giving western Canadian farmers nothing more than their right to manage their own businesses their own way. While we welcome constructive debate, frivolous delays will only hurt our farmers and the overall grain industry. We owe it to producers to provide market certainty so they can continue to plan their businesses. Farmers must plan for the 2012-2013 year. They are already putting inputs in the ground, getting ready. When they are making seeding decisions they will want to know what the marketing system will be for that 2012 crop. Canada will continue to sell wheat and barley and maintain its reputation as a quality, reliable supplier. The international grain trade works largely on forward contracting for future purchases and sales. If there is uncertainty in the market about the rules of who can sell Canadian wheat and barley, there is a high risk that buyers will turn to other countries to buy that wheat and barley. The Canadian wheat and barley sector can continue to supply domestic and world markets with high quality wheat and barley, but they look to us to provide the certainty they need to plan and carry out their business decisions. I invite my colleagues in the House to join us as we work to ensure that all farmers across Canada can position their businesses to capture the opportunities of the future.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20080408-411.4.10.6", "topic": "Oral Questions", "role": "government", "speaker": "Jim Prentice", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2008-04-08", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I welcome my friend to the House.

I hear cheering from across the way from a party that used to care about democracy. It was called the Reform Party and it was founded because its members were tired of the west being shut out and not being heard. It is astonishing to witness tonight the final nail in the coffin of any sense of reform, any sense of democratic input, any sense of direct democracy. It is dead. Its corpse is lying in front of us. It has given up. It is a funeral tonight not only for democracy but for a political movement that has died. It is no more. It has ceased to exist. It does not have a voice. As one of my friends has said, the fat cats are back. The cats are eating up everything they can find. They are joined by the other cats down the way. Those cats are willing to do whatever they can to feed their fat cat friends. The tax we are talking about will apply to people's funerals, haircuts, shoes, camps. Families whose kids play hockey in my community will be affected. They find it very difficult to make ends meet now and they will pay a tax on that activity, thanks to the Conservative Party. This tax will creep into everywhere. It will find every single cent in people's pockets. People will not be able to escape this tax. This tax will apply on things where the PST did not. I am very upset with our friends down the way, the other cats. Remember those cats? They are the Liberal cats. They said this was a hated sales tax. They used the Prime Minister 's last name when referring to the HST. They were going to fight it. That seems like minutes ago in politics, but now we see that they have joined the Conservatives to enable the legislation to go through. The legislation will apply an 8% tax which people have not had to pay before. How can those members in good conscience say that this is not something they are doing to the people of Ontario and B.C.? Where is the idea of representation taxation? It is gone from the Conservative Party. It does not exist as of tonight. It is not only about the tax. Let us look at what is happening. Tonight is all about closure. We know what that means. The government is ramming a bill down Parliament's throat. The body politic of this place will not be able to speak to this legislation to the degree it should. Why? I guess it is that the Conservatives understand that their base does not want this tax. They have been clear. In fact, their cousins in Ontario even decided to have a sit-in. I do not know if they talk to their cousins in Ontario any more, but they should pick up the phone, or in some cases talk over the breakfast table, and ask why it is they hate this tax. Their friends in Ontario might tell them it is regressive and it hurts people in the midst of a recession. The finance minister tells us time and time again that we have not seen a worldwide recession like this one since the Great Depression. What does the government do for this worldwide recession in Ontario and B.C.? They ding people with an 8% tax. If people are paying 8% more on things they need every day of their lives, it makes their lives more difficult. What we get from the government is a total reversal on raising taxes and on democracy. When that party sat on this side of the House, every time closure was imposed upon Parliament, it railed and raged against the machine. What is it doing now? Just put the oil on the wheels and let her rip. The Conservatives have been joined by their friends down the way. We see that Tweedledum and Tweedledee are back at it again, making sure that the people of Ontario and B.C. are basically financially and democratically screwed because of this legislation. What is next? Is this an emergency? Is this enabling legislation a national emergency? For the Conservatives I suppose it is a political emergency. They need to get this thing out very fast to make sure that no one sees this bait and switch. They actually think that the people of Ontario and B.C. will believe that this enabling legislation, using closure, has nothing to do with the Conservatives, that the $6 billion that will be leaving the coffers to go to B.C. and Ontario has nothing to do with them. The people of Ontario never got to vote on this proposition, and the people of B.C. not only did not get to vote on this proposition but their premier basically lied to them about the fact that he wanted to get a run on this. They never got to vote on it. It was a bait and switch scheme in B.C. and Ontario. People are not stupid. The people of Ontario and B.C. will make sure that this night is not forgotten. The night that the Conservatives put the final nail in the coffin of any notion of democratic reform from the Conservative Party will not be forgotten. To do it, the Conservatives made sure that we would not be able to debate a motion that would have an effect on them. If this proposition goes through the way the government wants it to go through, it will have undermined any notion of democratic reform from that party. It will undermine the financial viability of everyday people. It will also be saying to Canadians that in this Parliament, two major parties, the fat cats I talked about at the beginning of my speech, put their interests ahead of the interests of everyday people. I see that some of my friends across the way are laughing. They think it is funny to raise taxes by 8%. They think it is funny to be hypocrites. They fought closure when they were in opposition. It is not a happy night. It is not a great night. Democracy tonight is on the wane. Democracy tonight has been shut down. Democracy tonight has no voice on the government benches and no voice on the official opposition benches. Democracy tonight will have to be carried on by the NDP benches.

I also want to thank the hon. member for Sackville\u2014Eastern Shore for bringing this motion before the House today. The motion is timely as it relates to the unveiling of the federal budget at the end of this month. My friends in the NDP will certainly remember that day last fall when the Liberal Party presented a motion to the veterans affairs committee calling for public hearings into the cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. We presented that motion precisely out of concern that the Conservatives were going to continue with more cuts to the department, cuts that will harm our veterans and impact their services, cuts that will make it almost impossible for those who serve veterans to do their jobs. There was an embarrassing moment when the motion came up for debate. The Conservatives were opposed to my motion to have public hearings and voted against it. When the motion came up for debate at committee, some Conservative members did not show up on time for the vote. As a result, the Liberal motion passed. It did so thanks to the support of the NDP members who, I would point out, were on time. As one might imagine, the Conservatives were very angry at losing a vote in Parliament. Instead of doing the honourable thing by accepting the democratic decision to have public hearings, they took revenge. At the very next meeting, without consulting anyone in the opposition, including me as sponsor of the motion and vice-chair of the committee, the Conservatives brought in their own witnesses who dutifully, one might say robotically, recited the talking points issued by the minister, \u201cNothing to see here. Move along. All is well. Services will not be impaired\u201d. However, the minister's witnesses did give evidence that up to 500 jobs, not including the lost jobs due to the budget cuts or the transfer of the last veterans hospital in Canada, would be lost within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Once the Conservative witnesses had their say, they moved to an in camera secret meeting. They emerged from that secret meeting with a motion that shut down public hearings. I share this background information to highlight the fact that the opposition parties and veterans groups have been on this issue for many months calling on the government to halt its cuts. However, it is not just Liberals or the official opposition who are concerned about the cuts to veterans. The vast majority of Canadians, including young Canadians, want to preserve the benefits and services we provide to our veterans. Just this past weekend I had the honour of participating in the annual Prince Edward Island model parliament. These young people get it. They understand that veterans deserve respect. They had two days of debate, two days in which to identify their priorities and pass bills in their model parliament. One of the bills passed in those two days was the veterans tax act, exempting veterans from provincial income tax. That displays a deep appreciation from young people for the sacrifices our veterans have made for Canada. These are people whose great-grandparents, three generations removed from them, may know what it is like to be a traditional veteran. Many of them would be shocked to hear that the Conservatives are engaging in a process to cut money from the Department of Veterans Affairs. If the example of our young people is not enough, let us consider what other countries are doing for veterans. The United States, which is in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, is exempting veterans from any budget cuts. Likewise, the United Kingdom, which also is in the midst of a terrible financial crisis, has exempted veterans from budget cuts, as has Australia. Canadians from all walks of life, from young people to seniors, are wondering why the Conservative government is not exempting Canadian veterans from cuts as well. The parliamentary secretary and the minister, or whoever else is responsible for reading the Conservative roboscript, will say that the opposition is just trying to scare veterans. That simply is not true. The proposed 5% to 10% cuts and the ensuing job losses at the department will have immediate and lasting impacts on the quality of service to our veterans. It must stop. The government must exempt veterans from cuts. The minister's talking points repeat continually, regardless of the question posed, that veterans' benefits are statutory or quasi-statutory, meaning those benefits are automatic and not subject to yearly budget considerations. Again this is false. The fact is that the veterans affairs committee approves the yearly estimates. As the minister himself pointed out a few minutes ago, the money is allocated to the department by Parliament and the committee could at any time decline to authorize those amounts earmarked for benefits. Veterans' benefits are not guaranteed. They are discretionary. That discretion rests with the parliamentary committee and with Parliament. As indicated, tomorrow the committee will deliberate on the estimates. The committee has the right and power to reject the minister's request for approval of additional funds. Again, the Government of Canada must exempt Veterans Affairs Canada from any budget cuts. I want to disabuse another falsehood, that being the contention made by government that due to ongoing demographic changes in the makeup of veterans, almost all of the budget cuts will be achieved through attrition. Again, this is misleading. This really means that the Conservatives are on a death watch. They know that upward of 1,500 World War II veterans and Korean veterans, the traditional veterans as we call them, die each month. The Conservatives see the death rate as an opportunity to direct funds previously paid to veterans to other priorities, such as more politicians and bigger jails. If there are to be savings as a result of dying veterans, why would the government not invest those savings into providing better and more comprehensive services for veterans? For example, it is disgraceful that a Canadian Forces member currently would receive upward of $13,000 for burial costs should he or she die in service, and yet veterans, if they qualify, receive around $3,600 when they die. For years the Last Post Fund has been pressing for an increase to no avail. An uncomplicated application for a hearing aid from a veteran takes 16 weeks. In Halifax last week we heard from a family doctor who has restricted her practice to caring only for veterans. She has a patient who was recently released from the Canadian Forces. While in the Canadian Forces he was in regular need of nerve blocks. After his release he was treated as any other civilian. The wait period for his nerve blocks is 18 months. This is wrong and it must change. We also know that the department conducts a national client survey wherein it polls veterans with respect to how they view the services provided. These surveys we now know have very low participation rates among veterans and are now under scrutiny from veterans organizations. I had the opportunity last week to meet with the president of Our Duty, a wonderful veterans organization, which today released a comprehensive examination of how the department conducts its national client survey. People should remember that these surveys help guide the department in how it serves veterans. Suffice it to say there are grave concerns about the very methodology used. I invite Canadians to review the study conducted by Our Duty. The point I am trying to make is that the notion the government can simply use savings from dying veterans to pay down a deficit which the government created is very offensive to veterans who want better, not fewer, services. We know well the record of the government when it comes to cuts and providing services. My colleagues from Cardigan , Malpeque and Cape Breton\u2014Canso all remember how Canadians were impacted when services were cut. We all remember how cruelly the Conservative government treated EI claimants this past Christmas, when thousands of Canadians who were expecting their money waited for weeks upon weeks to get their money, all because the Conservatives failed them by cutting staff and services. More recently within that same department, Service Canada, the online service for jobs seekers has been out of service for weeks. We need investment in services to veterans, not cuts. Consider what great work might be achieved if the government invested, for example, in the veterans transition program at the University of British Columbia. This is a group-based therapeutic program that helps veterans make the difficult transition back to civilian life after physical or emotional injuries suffered in combat. This program is able to survive, thanks to the Royal Canadian Legion, not the Department of Veterans Affairs. Here, the Department of Veterans Affairs could use the money it apparently is saving as a result of the death of traditional veterans to invest in programs such as this. This program works; the committee saw it first hand. It should be supported by government. Consider also the tremendous initiative led by Dr. Alice Aitken at Queen's University who, along with her team, has founded the Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran Health Research, CIMVHR, dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being our veterans and active military personnel through world-class research. Does the government not think that providing financial support to these efforts might result in new understandings and treatments for such issues as post-traumatic stress disorder, and in doing so provide better services for our veterans? Some Conservative backbench members of Parliament know these cuts are wrong and will hurt veterans. I wish they would stand up and be heard. I will close by suggesting that in the midst of this debate on cuts, there really is a meaningful context. Just two weeks ago, I spoke in the House about the life of the last surviving World War I veteran. Her name was Mrs. Florence Green and she died this past September. She was 110 years old when she passed away. I expressed at the time how deeply meaningful it was to consider the sacrifice made by so many to fight tyranny and to defend the liberty, freedom, democracy and, yes, the right to vote without impediment. Tens of thousands of Canadians have given their lives for these rights. I really do believe that sometimes we forget that. We work and are busy with life and sometimes we forget that we really do owe our veterans a debt of gratitude. I would end by just saying this, and I hope my colleagues will remember it: We say to all those Canadians who have served in our military in conflicts past and present, they have already made their sacrifice. They stood for us and now we must be there for them, and we say no to any cuts.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20121024-14704.5.1.29", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Thomas Mulcair", "party": "New Democratic Party", "date": "2012-10-24", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for your ruling in this regard and remind you that this complaint is coming from the person who, earlier, referred us to page 282 of the budget, saying that it had to do with the Navigable Waters Protection Act when such is not the case. The changes in the budget change the rules of the game for teachers and engineers. What we are trying to say about employment insurance is that, from now on, people will have to look for jobs located up to an hour away from where they live, otherwise they will lose their benefits. This is an unbelievable threat to industries that depend on seasonal workers. For example, what are people in Atlantic Canada who work in the fishery supposed to do if the minister is saying that, from now on, they have to move? Someone cannot train to be a fisher in five hours, five days or even five months. It takes several seasons to train someone to work on a boat. The government is already draining these communities of their lifeblood because of our artificially high dollar. All our export industries are suffering terribly. This is being felt in Atlantic Canada in particular. Governing also means understanding the country, the regional differences and the different regional needs. Rather than making allowances for that, the Conservatives are applying the same remedy everywhere. They are attacking regions that are sorely in need of a helping hand. Instead of that help, these regions are getting hit hard. That is what the Conservatives are doing. What is more, the Conservatives are creating an economy where salaries will be much lower. There is less pressure with regard to all working conditions because of a series of measures that are being implemented. It is not by chance that, for the first time in Canada's history, the middle class has seen a clear drop in income, and this occurred in tandem with the signing of NAFTA. Over the past 25 years, the middle class has seen its real net income drop. This is the first time this has happened. In other words, the richest 20% of Canadians are experiencing a rise in income while the other 80% of Canadians\u2014it has been measured and proven\u2014are experiencing a drop in income. These are the results of the neo-conservative policies of the current government and its Liberal predecessors, who aggressively pursued the same goals for 25 years. This is putting downward pressure on incomes and on employment conditions. As though that were not enough, these agreements are creating a race to the bottom: temporary foreign workers who used to come and work in a few sectors, such as produce farms, will now be in several employment categories. The government trumpets the fact that we can pay them a lot less than Canadians. People are working hard in mines and many other sectors and what is the result? One simply has to go visit the steelworkers in Prince George, British Columbia, to see what kind of pressure they are under. It is hard work. They work hard their entire lives. They fought hard for fair wages only to be told that the Conservatives are going to force them to work two years longer before they can retire. Then, as though these workers did not have enough pressure on them, the Conservatives want to bring in workers from other countries and pay them lower wages, and this adds even more downward pressure. That is the Canada the Conservatives dream of, where workers are subjected to working conditions from the early 1900s. That is their vision. The NDP wants to build a fair Canada. We hear appalling speeches, like the one we heard earlier, suggesting that our dream is heresy. A country as rich as Canada is capable of paying for decent working conditions, and that is part of what an NDP government will bring. That is the path that the Conservatives are paving for us. Do not forget that Bill C-38 , the Conservatives' budget bill in the spring, repealed the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act. That is their vision. They are not attacking one particular group or sector. Their goal is to drive down wages for all Canadians, a total lack of an economic plan. The government is not just failing workers but businesses that create jobs too. Canada faces a perfect storm of economic challenges. We have 500,000 lost manufacturing jobs, a $50 billion trade deficit, household debt at an all-time high, the worst American downturn since the Great Depression, and we are still in the middle of a eurozone crisis. When we talk to Conservatives about the interest that we have in using our experience, our expertise and our capability to help in Europe, we get the usual talking points of \u201cYou want us to write a big cheque to Europe\u201d. What imbecility. As if the idea of using our experience and our expertise to help avoid a crisis that will invariably negatively affect us is something wrong. Yet those are the talking points that come out of the PMO because they make stuff up. That is all they have. They have nothing else. They make up pages in the budget and they make up plans for the NDP that have never existed, other than the ones that were the same ones they had. They make stuff up all day long because they cannot defend what they are actually doing. That is what we are talking about now, what is actually in here, what they are actually doing and the negative effect it is having on Canadian workers across the country. What an irony Bill C-45 is. The jobs and growth act does not contain a plan to generate either. Budget 2012 kills more jobs than it creates. It contains no strategy for the 1.4 million out-of-work Canadians. The so-called centrepiece of the economic plan is the small business tax credit, which members can applaud because the NDP supports a tax credit. It was part of our 2011 platform. This one does not go far enough. It is worth a maximum of $1,000 and it lasts just one year. At best, it may be enough to help companies hire one full-time employee. It will not even make a dent in our lagging job numbers. The truth is that the government continues its failed policy of lavish corporate tax cuts, even as companies ship jobs overseas. For example, one company demanded a 50% pay cut and shut its doors after receiving $5 million from the Conservatives. It was called Electro-Motive Diesel in London. I got to visit the workers on the picket line in the middle of the winter. It was an extraordinary experience because just a few months earlier a beaming Prime Minister had been out there with a $5 million cheque, because this was evidence of the success of his plan for jobs in Canada. As soon as that election campaign was over, there was a little meeting. The bosses sat down and said, \u201cWe have a deal for you. You accept a 50% pay cut or we move your jobs south of the border\u201d. The company closed, the jobs have been moved, it kept the $5 million and there are no longer any jobs in Canada. That is the Conservative plan. Thirty years ago a young worker could work his or her way up a company ladder. Now workers have many different jobs in a lifetime. The incentive to invest in workers is being lost. A large workforce is no longer a sign of pride. A couple of generations ago, someone who was running a big company would be very proud and take great pride in stating the numbers in his workforce. Now the great pride is saying how many of those jobs were shipped to another country. That is the change. We have to get back to a feeling in Canada that it is a social responsibility to be proud to be creating good-paying jobs. Why do we keep doing what the Conservatives do, investing in companies like Electro-Motive Diesel that do not invest in our workforce? This is the type of short-sightedness that we see all over Bill C-45 . For example, under the changes to the scientific research and experimental development tax credit, the program would be cut. The $500 million a year that it costs would be eliminated, but it would also reduce government support for business research and development at a time when businesses need to increase innovation to compete. To put it another way, if we cannot get the Conservatives to do the right thing because it is the right thing, let us try to get them to do the right thing because it is actually good for the economy. The only way to increase wealth in our society is to increase knowledge, and this is the dumbing down of Canadian business. That is the Conservative legacy. It is going to hit manufacturing particularly hard at a time when they need a little oxygen to keep going. We need tailored incentives that better serve businesses and our economy as a whole. There are a couple of good examples that can be looked at in Canada where long-term vision and incentive by the government has produced a great result. For example, take a look at the TV and film industry in Toronto. There used to be a time when it was only New York and Hollywood. Now, Toronto is in there competing with them every step of the way, but it required a partnership between government, business and labour. Those tax incentives were there for decades and they worked their way through the system and are producing the great result of bringing in billions of dollars a year and lots of high-quality jobs. However, it required government involvement every step of the way. The Conservatives simply do not believe in that. We should be building the next success story now. Instead, we are getting less for workers, less for Canadians and less for our economy. That is what the Conservatives are about, less for everyone. In the business environment there should be the creation of a climate for growth. We have to ensure predictability. However, look at the catastrophe this week with the sale of a gas company. The government cannot even give the criteria on which the decision was based and it released its decision at 11:57 p.m. on a Friday. The Conservatives cannot explain the decision. They have to hide it. Then when they come back into the House, they go back to their talking points and keep referring to the statute, but the decision uses criteria that are not in the statute. How is a foreign company looking to invest in Canada supposed to make an intelligent decision? We saw the effect on the stock market immediately on Monday. Stocks were getting pummelled. People do not know. This is a government that boasts about being close to business, but its actual decisions are hurting business. This lack of predictability is something that we would change. We would clarify the rules for foreign investment. We would welcome investments and trade as long as it was reciprocal, responsible and fair. What concerns us the most is that since 2009, there has been a strong trend towards eviscerating anything that has to do with environmental protection in Canada. In 2009, the government even did away with one of the first steps, which was the Navigable Waters Protection Act. I remember that the Minister of Foreign Affairs called it the greatest job killer. We were confused. At the time, we told ourselves that it was not possible to pit the environment against the economy, since the past 50 years have shown us that they go hand in hand, because both of these things must progress together. I remember being speechless in parliamentary committee, when I saw the Liberal Party vote with the Conservatives for the first time to start dismantling the Navigable Waters Protection Act. That was in 2009. That continued in 2010 and 2011, based on what we are seeing here. They are getting rid of the protections that are so important for everyone. But the businesses themselves are the ones that want some predictability in all of this. They do not want to end up being told that they did not fulfill their obligations. Instead of enforcing federal environmental protection legislation, such as the Fisheries Act, the Species at Risk Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, and so on, what are they doing? They are gutting these laws and changing them completely. This is interesting, because we know that there are procedures, processes and ways of doing things, particularly in the oil sands, where the federal government no longer enforces these laws. The lack of enforcement will cause more degradation of ecosystems. This government claims to be a law and order government. Normally, when a company violates the law, we force it to change its practices. But the Conservatives instead change the law to bring it in line with those practices. I will give a concrete example having to do with the Navigable Waters Protection Act, which we were talking about earlier. In Canada, 37 rivers are considered to be heritage rivers. Of these 37 rivers, 27 will no longer be protected. Now, 27 of Canada's 37 designated heritage rivers will no longer be protected. They include the Bloodvein River, in Manitoba and Ontario; the Cowichan River, British Columbia; the Clearwater River, Saskatchewan and Alberta; the Main River, Newfoundland and Labrador; the Margaree River, in Nova Scotia; the South Nahanni River, Northwest Territories; the Tatshenshini River, Yukon; the Mattawa River, Ontario; and the Upper Restigouche River, New Brunswick. Mr. Speaker, I actually enjoy responding to the peanut gallery when they heckle. The question was, \u201cIs it navigable?\u201d Duh, yes. It is a definition in the law. No amount of rebranding will take away from the fact that the Navigable Waters Protection Act was meant to ensure sustainable development for future generations. I mentioned the decision of Judge Lamer in the Oldman River case in my opening remarks. Let me read one section: The Minister of Transport, in his capacity of decision maker under the Navigable Waters Protection Act must thus consider the environmental impact of the dam on such areas of federal jurisdiction as navigable waters, fisheries, Indians and Indian lands. After that, the Conservatives stood up and said that law had nothing to do with the environment. Shame. It is Orwellian. The Conservatives made their website disappear after a question was asked by my colleague from Halifax yesterday. There were 29 references to the environment, and the Conservatives made them disappear. They want to make the environment disappear. We are going to stand up and protect the environment, for now and for future generations. We are going to continue to fight the Conservatives' omnibus budget bills. There are two different aspects that are being discussed today. When we look at the contents of what they are proposing, we get the results we are looking at here. We are hurting people. We are taking away programs. We are taking away protections that have been given in Canada for generations. Before we even look at those, there is an aspect that all Canadians have to consider in what we are going through today, which is the continuation of what the Conservatives started in the spring. This type of omnibus budget bill is affecting dozens and dozens of different laws. We have fallen into the American trap of avoiding our parliamentary debate. Our system is different from the American budget system, where they tack on and tack on. We remember the Prime Minister , and it was not something we have said, admitting that he never watches Canadian television and he never watches the Canadian news. He gets all his news from the Fox network. I guess it is not surprising that he thinks the American system applies here and he has simply given instructions to his House leader and his other officers to start following the American system of using a budget bill as sort of a catch-all, where they can throw in all the stuff they want to change. That is what we have here, again. That is an undermining of our parliamentary democracy. Those are our institutions. The Conservatives are not only taking away things like medicare, free universal public medical care, and putting it in danger, the cuts I referred to earlier, the $36 billion that they announced without discussion or debate will lead inexorably to a two-tier system. That is just a fancy way of saying that poor people are going to have trouble seeing a doctor and rich people will have access because they will be able to pay for it. That is not the Canadian system. That is not the Canadian way. We will stand up and fight that. Yes, at every step, we will stand up because for the first time in a very long time we are beginning to have hope. In the next campaign, there will be two opposing visions for our country. There is the Conservative vision, which slashes the social safety net and takes out $10 billion every year. That is the figure they tried to hide. The cat was out of the bag yesterday. I heard the member for Saint Boniface say earlier that they held lengthy budget briefings. Let us talk about those briefings. I was the finance critic for the official opposition for five budgets before I became the leader of the official opposition. Never before had I seen what I saw last spring. We often see the same people from year to year. They are usually in their offices. There is very little reason for them to be here, except for the few times they attend parliamentary committee hearings. Officials are there to provide us with information. When I saw not only the budget cuts, but also the two-year increase in the retirement age, I went to see them to ask for a single figure that could be readily obtained. I asked them what adding two years of work would mean and how much money the government would be taking out of seniors' pockets. This is what they told me, and I quote: \u201cI can't give you that information.\u201d I know a half-truth when I hear it. So I answered: Are you telling me you can't give me that information because you don't have it, or are you telling me you have that information but you can't give it to me? And the response, which was worthy of George Orwell, was: \u201cI can't give you that information.\u201d That is the Conservatives. Yesterday the Auditor General confirmed the overall number. The Minister of Finance was asked that question at a press conference right in front of the House of Commons a few months ago. On our side, we had estimated that it was somewhere between $10 billion and $12 billion. We were not far off. They estimated it at $10 billion. The minister refused to give the number. He replied with his usual smile, as though he were saying \u201cI do not give a damn\u201d, that he had heard approximate numbers. Imagine that, a Minister of Finance who says such things. I can say one thing to my colleagues and to any seniors watching us at home: they can be sure that the two-year increase in the retirement age will be cancelled by an NDP government; we will put the retirement age back to 65. We will stand up, unlike the members opposite who, day after day, have to parrot the lines written by the Prime Minister 's Office. They sometimes have one minute a day in their poor little parliamentary lives to finally talk about their ridings and about real issues, and what do they do? They act like parrots. They are puppets, marionettes. They stand up and say exactly what the Prime Minister's Office tells them to say. We can be reasonable. We can stand up and keep the real objectives in mind. We tell Canadians that when it comes to pensions, the integrity of our Parliament and our free, public health care system, we are proud to stand up for them. We will stand up for the environment, because we in the NDP know that we deserve better than what the Conservatives have been offering us for the past six years. Since the Conservatives came to power, they have found many opportunities to invent titles for bills that say exactly the opposite of the bill's contents. Last week, I had the opportunity to say that if, by chance, they actually used the most recent incarnation of the mammoth budget bill to do what they promised to do in the election campaign, which was create jobs, we would vote in favour of the bill. In the comments I made yesterday, I clearly explained that we could have a good discussion about some of the elements in this bill if we could split it. It could be done by splitting the bill and having different committees study it. We believe that some things can and must be done. I gave an example earlier when I spoke about tax credits for creating jobs. That is how we could go about it. We will not let the Conservatives fool us. We have become too accustomed to their empty promises. We are telling them outright that if they split the bill and divide it into coherent parts that can be easily studied, they will find that our party is willing to co-operate. We shall see what they end up doing. We will test the Conservatives' ability to be true to their word. In the case of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, we saw that they said one thing and what was in the documents was altogether different. Here are some of the elements that could be split off from the bill. Here are some of the elements of Bill C-45 that could be split off from the bill and studied separately and properly in a parliamentary committee. It has already been shown it is possible because we did it last week. By the way, I open a little parenthesis to say that there are 450,000 public servants in Canada who are very happy that the NDP actually read what the Liberals were putting in, because such is the Liberal incompetence that they were about to give one-two-three agreement to the enactment of a law that would have taken MPs' and senators' pensions and dealt with them on the same footing as the pensions of 450,000 civil servants. The NDP stood up, demanded a change, and was able to get it done right. It was so pathetic to see the House leader for the Liberals standing in the hallway, stuttering away, saying, \u201cIt was a spelling mistake. It was a typographical error.\u201d That is one of his classics. Four hundred and fifty-thousand people are a typographical error for the Liberals. Here are some of the elements that could be split off from the bill. The gutting of the Canada Environmental Assessment Act should be before the environment committee. The gutting of the Navigable Waters Protection Act should be before the environment and transportation committee. The elimination of the Hazardous Materials Information Review Commission should, of course, go to the health committee. Cutting the SR and ED tax credits should be before the industry committee. Changes to the Fisheries Act should go to fisheries and oceans committee. Changes to the Indian Act should go to aboriginal affairs and northern development committee. Changes to the new Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act should go before the transportation committee. Eliminating the grain act tribunal should go before the agriculture committee, and pension reforms should go before the human resources, skills and social development committee. Therefore, I would like to seek unanimous consent, and I am sure it is going to be given, to move the following motion. That notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice of the House, that Bill C-45, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 29, 2012 and other measures be amended by removing the following clauses: (a) clauses 9, 27, 28 and 62 to 64 related to the scientific research and experimental development tax credit; (b) clauses 173 to 178 related to the Fisheries Act; (c) clauses 179 to 184 related to the proposed bridge to strengthen trade act; (d) clauses 206 to 209 related to the Indian Act; (e) clauses 210 to 218 related to the Judges Act; (f) clauses 264 to 268 related to the Customs Act; (g) clauses 269 to 298 related to the Hazardous Materials Information Review Act; (i) clauses 316 to 350 related to the Navigable Waters Protection Act; (j) clauses 351 to 410 related to the Canada Grains Act; (k) clauses 425 to 432 related to the Canada Environmental Assessment Act; and (l) clauses 464 to 514 related to pension reforms That the clauses mentioned in section (a) of this motion do compose Bill C-47; that Bill C-47 be deemed read a first time and be printed; that the order for second reading of the said bill provide for the referral to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. That the clauses mentioned in section (b) of this motion do compose Bill C-48; that Bill C-48 be deemed read a first time and be printed; that the order for second reading of the said bill provide for the referral to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. That the clauses mentioned in section (c) of this motion do compose Bill C-49; that Bill C-49 be deemed read a first time and be printed; that the order for second reading of the said bill provide for the referral to the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

I will be splitting my time with the fine, eloquent hon. member of Parliament for Dartmouth\u2014Cole Harbour . We have heard over the last few months how the Conservatives have characterized their government. This is the first report of the finance committee that comes from the so-called stable majority government. If Tommy Douglas were still in the House, he would say that the government sure smells like a stable. It is true that when we look at the economic industries of the last few months, since the government's re-election on May 2, we can see that the report does not refer to what the reality is on the ground for the vast majority of Canadian families. I will take much of my time, before I turn it over to my colleague from Dartmouth\u2014Cole Harbour , to speak exactly to what has happened to Canadian families under the Conservative government? I want to reference a few key statistics, which we do not always have the time in question period to raise but on which we would love to have a response from the government. The first two are related to trade statistics. The government has the worst merchandise trade deficit in Canadian history. It also has the worst deficit in current account of balance of payments in this nation's history. That is what the government has managed to create after six years. Now what does that mean? First, what we have seen is a complete erosion of our manufacturing sector. What we have seen is a loss of 400,000 good family sustaining manufacturing jobs. We have seen all of that, which certainly explains the record merchandise trade deficit. The government would respond that we are shipping raw resources out of the country and that is making up for it. The reality is that, when we look at the current account deficit on balance of payments, the worst ever under the government, we see that, even with the shipping out of raw logs, raw minerals and raw bitumen, the government has simply put manufacturing jobs, the good quality jobs that we used to enjoy in this economy, in jeopardy through what can only be described as very foolish policies. The fifth report does not reflect that reality. I will now talk about the quality of jobs, which is also not reflected in the majority report presented by the finance committee. When we look at the quality of jobs, we see that most of the jobs created under the Conservative government are part-time or temporary, very precarious jobs. We are talking about Canadian families that are struggling to make ends meet, trying to hold together a couple of part-time jobs, if they can, and trying to go from temporary contract to temporary contract. The quality of jobs under the present government is very clearly failing. As I mentioned earlier, 400,000 lost manufacturing jobs are a stain on the record of the government, which will go down for generations. I will now talk about the quantity of jobs. The Conservatives love to stand in the House and throw out these figures on job creation under their government. Statistic Canada tells a completely different story because, rather than just inventing statistics out of its gut, it actually tracks and produces the real stats of what is happening in the Canadian economy. Since May 2008 through to the fall, which I will get back to a moment, we actually saw the job creation record of the government being a scant 200,000 jobs. The problem is that the labour force over that same time grew not by 200,000 or 300,000 or 400,000 but by 450,000 jobs. What that means for the average Canadian is that the government produced 200,000 jobs when 450,000 were needed just to tread water, just to stand still. There again we see a real failure of the government. It is a quarter of a million jobs short, even before we hit the fall. What happened in the fall? The New Democrats certainly know because we are in touch with our constituents and with our communities. Many MPs from our side of the House, as well as Conservatives, have seen factory closures in their ridings. What we have seen is the loss of 60,000 full-time jobs, 60,000 families have lost their breadwinner, 60,000 times workers got that feeling in their gut, having to go home and tell their family that maybe the kids will not be able to go to summer camp this year, that the family will need to rein in their expenses and maybe that they will not be able to keep their home. That happened 60,000 times under the government in just the span of the last few months. I will now talk about salaries. In the last year, the average Canadian family has lost 2% of its real income. Families are struggling to make ends meet with less and less under the government. Any jobs that the Conservatives created pay $10,000 a year less than the jobs that were lost. They have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and have made them up with part-time and temporary jobs that pay $10,000 a year less. I will now go to the final category, which is how families are faring under the Conservatives. As New Democrats know, because we are in touch with our constituents, the average Canadian family is now struggling under the greatest debt load in our nation's history. Families are struggling to keep their head above water, struggling to pay the expenses, all because the government simply does not know how to manage the economy. At the same time, we have also seen record levels of income inequality that take us back to the years of the Great Depression. We are now seeing a small minority of Canadians earning most of the real income in this country. Those are shocking statistics but those are realities. That is what many Canadians told the finance committee and talked about in the prebudgetary hearings that were held across this country. That is not reflected in the majority report. This is a fundamental problem when we have Conservatives on the committee who simply will not recognize the economic reality of so many Canadian families. How have the Conservatives decided to proceed? We get a sense of this in the fifth report but even more so when we look at the main estimates that we have been talking about over the last few days, and the issues and questions that MPs from the NDP have been raising in the House, responding to our constituents' needs and to what our constituents have been telling us. They have been saying that they do not believe the government is on the right track at all when it wants to spend billions of dollars on untendered jet fighters that have serious flaws and problems. The F-35s were supposed to cost $9 billion. That escalated to $15 billion or $16 billion, then $20 billion and now more than $30 billion. As most members know, no one on that side of the House actually knows what the total cost of the F-35s will be. The government is talking about $30 billion and potentially $40 billion. On this side of the House, we are saying that we need to start anew. If we want to replace the CF-18s, we need to re-tender it at a fixed price and ensure that any costing that comes out of the federal government is held rigidly in check. The government has also put forward a very costly prisons agenda. That has been evaluated but no one on the Conservative side has been able to say with any certainty how much it would cost. We have had independent evaluations done that show the total amount would be close to $19 billion. These are not the priorities of Canadian families that are struggling under record debt load and are looking for a break. They are looking for a government that cares about them, is willing to invest in job creation, is willing to invest in services to help those families and is willing to put forward the kinds of priorities that are fundamental Canadian values that we all share. We do not see those priorities reflected at all in the majority report. From the recollection that we have from the Canadians who came forward to the finance committee and tell their stores, we do not even see that reflected in the report. What we do have, thankfully, is a minority report of the NDP that talks about reinforcing our pension system so that we can lift seniors out of poverty and have a solid pension system for years to come. In our minority report, we talk about job creation programs, putting in place a real priority for the federal government to create good, family sustaining jobs, the kind of jobs the Conservatives have lost over the last few years. In the minority report, we talk about reforming research and development, which has been a failed policy under the Conservatives. We talk about opening doors to post-secondary education. We talk about ensuring that Canadian consumers are protected from some of the financial practices that gouge them every day. We talk about empowering a green economy and investing in critical infrastructure. We talk about investing in children's early education and building that quality post-secondary education that leads to the jobs of tomorrow. In short, the report talks about the kinds of priorities that Canadians really have, the kinds of values that we all share and the kind of direction in which Canadians want to see this country go. In the minority report of the fifth report of the finance committee, we see what Canadians want: an economy that is built so that we can have the country we all desire, a country where everyone matters and nobody is left behind. That is the kind of economy Canadians want to build and that is what we presented in our minority report.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20120507-3186.3.16.1", "topic": "Statements By Members", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Blake Richards", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2012-05-07", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, the recently announced NDP shadow cabinet contains the member for London\u2014Fanshawe , the critic for pensions.

The bill cannot be considered in isolation. Bill C-4 implements parts of this year's budget, and this year's budget is just another phase in Canada's economic action plan, an approach to governance that has allowed Canada's economy to lead the world through unstable times. Since the global financial crisis that triggered this uncertainty, each year I hear members opposite claim that the government's policies would end up hurting Canadians. Each year statistics prove their worries are totally unfounded. While members opposite continue to attack our Minister of Finance , impartial experts continue to honour him as the world's best. While I expect the hyperbole to continue in discussing Bill C-4 , I would remind Canadians to consider the following when they hear the opposition parties attacking our record. Our debt to GDP ratio is by far the lowest in the G7. Since the depth of the global recession, Canada has created almost a million net new jobs, the strongest record in the G7. These facts are praiseworthy on their own, but please also remember that we are on track to return to surplus. When the budget returns to surplus, we will not only enjoy the strongest record of job creation and fiscal discipline in the industrialized world, but we will also enjoy the benefits of investments made during the stimulus phase. In Waterloo region, we have seen much needed expansion to our local post-secondary institutions to develop the talent and innovation that we need to remain prosperous. Conestoga College is better positioned than ever before to help business innovate their processes, and now operates a school of food processing technologies. Food and food processing is Ontario's second largest industry, but this school is the first of its kind in Ontario. We have seen community centres built or refurbished, and critical infrastructure such as waste water and roads renewed. We have witnessed the explosive growth of high technology startups, coalescing around the federally supported Communitech hub. We have seen the impact of programs designed for southwestern Ontario delivered by way of the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, or FedDev, helping businesses such as Miovision Technologies capture new markets, and non-profits such as the Southern Ontario Locomotive Restoration Society build a station for the Waterloo Central Railway, a tourist link between the city of Waterloo and St. Jacobs in the township of Woolwich. The agricultural adaptation program has supported businesses such as Martin's Family Fruit Farm, bringing apple chips to market, a healthy snack food that opens new markets for Canadian orchards. I could devote an entire speech to the investments our government has made in the Region of Waterloo Airport in Breslau that resulted in a safer facility, capable of handling a more diverse set of aircraft, which is critical for our area's continued growth. All of this was accomplished during the most severe downturn since the Great Depression, while remaining on track for our return to surplus and without raising taxes on Canadians; all of this without raising punitive taxes on Canadians, as both opposition parties are calling for; all of this without gutting transfers to the provinces, as the previous Liberal government did. How is it possible, Canadians may wonder, for a government to maintain the world's best financial position, while also maintaining low taxes, maintaining transfers to provinces and individuals, and renewing Canada's infrastructure on top of all of that. In my opening comments I noted that Bill C-4 implements budget 2013, which is the latest phase of Canada's economic action plan. However, even Canada's economic action plan is itself an implementation of our Conservative government's long-term financial plan for Canada, released in 2006, called Advantage Canada. Advantage Canada outlined the five priority themes our government would focus on through good times and bad. Our belief was that if Canada could focus on lowering taxes, keeping our books in order, unleashing our entrepreneurial culture, building world-class talent and maintaining world-class infrastructure, Canada could reach new levels of prosperity to pass on to our children and to our children's children. Budget 2013 continued our focus on these priorities, and Bill C-4 implements measures that will enhance Canada's advantage in these key areas. Bill C-4 , among other things, expands the eligibility for the accelerated capital cost allowance to include a broader range of equipment used in clean energy generation and biogas production. Budget 2013 renewed the accelerated capital cost allowance, and Bill C-4 expands on that application. The accelerated capital cost allowance has been praised by businesses of all sizes in my riding. From Riverside Brass in New Hamburg to Chemtura in Elmira, businesses are investing in new equipment to keep themselves on top of a competitive global economy, thanks to our initiative. Depreciation is used by businesses to write off the value of their equipment according to government-set schedules. By accelerating the depreciation schedule to a more realistic rate, we are allowing the tax system to recognize the speed of business rather than slowing business to the speed of government. By making more of the equipment that is used in clean energy and biogas production eligible for the accelerated capital cost allowance, we are removing obstacles to growth. Bill C-4 would also implement budget 2013's commitment to extend the hiring credit. This measure incents small businesses, Canada's largest source of job creation, to expand and grow by providing up to $1,000 to offset the increase in EI premiums as an employer takes on employment with new growth. Over a half a million small businesses would take advantages of this opportunity, creating jobs for Canadians. However, the legislation would do more than help small businesses grow and create jobs. Bill C-4 would make it more attractive for Canadians to pursue entrepreneurship and to pass their businesses on to the next generation. Small-business owners were happy to hear that Bill C-4 would increase their lifetime capital gains exemption by $50,000 to a total of $800,000, but they were ecstatic to learn that going forward this would be indexed. Many of them remember when the lifetime capital gains exemption went unadjusted for almost two decades, until this government assumed office. That is one more example of 13 years of inaction. It was wrong. It was unfair to small-business owners, who often put over 60 hours each week into their business, to blame inflation for making their retirement less and less viable. Never again. If I could be permitted to diverge for a quick moment, many of my colleagues have asked what the mood is like in Waterloo Region, given the uncertainty around BlackBerry's future intentions. Despite recent challenges at BlackBerry, our mood remains positive and confident. Our community is headquarters to close to 1,000 technology companies that generate $30 billion in annual revenue. The collaborative sensibilities, scientific excellence and entrepreneurial culture that fostered BlackBerry's growth remain strong. Our government's initiatives will certainly provide encouragement. Our investments supporting the creation of the successful Communitech hub, investing in talent at local universities and at Conestoga College, reducing red tape and incenting venture capital into the system have all been well received and are already making tangible results. However, in government there is always a cost. On this side of the House, we feel these costs are justified as investments that will pay dividends for years to come, but that does not mean our ability to spend is limitless. Especially in these uncertain times, with so many priorities competing for federal dollars, it is more important than ever that all levels of government collect every dollar they are legitimately owed. Individuals and businesses who evade their taxes are not just pulling a fast one, they are denying money to our hospitals, first nations, student aid programs and other critical needs. Every tax dollar owed that remains uncollected is an extra dollar that someone else's tax bill assumes. Tax evasion has become much more sophisticated and our enforcement measures must keep pace. As a member of Parliament who has encouraged action against the underground economy, I was pleased to see that Bill C-4 would introduce sanctions including monetary and criminal penalties to deter the use of software designed to falsify sales records for the purpose of tax evasion. This is not a revolution in approach; it is a natural evolution of our laws in response to the evolution of technologies, which is continually accelerating. It is much like the action called for in my Motion No. 388 targeting Internet predators, which received the unanimous support of the House several Parliaments ago. These types of improvements can be supported by all parliamentarians regardless of partisan stripe. Bill C-4 would be the final step in implementing budget 2013. I ask all members of the House, especially those who claim to make decisions based on evidence, to accept the opinion of impartial experts from around the world that the Conservative government's approach has brought Canada to lead the world, to accept this latest phase of Canada's economic action plan, which would be just as beneficial to Canadians, and to get on board.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20130503-15294.5.1.39", "topic": "Government Orders", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Dave Van Kesteren", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2013-05-03", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to the budget implementation, creating jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for Canadians.

In 2009 we experienced the global meltdown we all remember so vividly. Some would call it a recession, but in some places in the world it is called a depression. It was definitely the worst thing that happened to our economics in this country and around the world since the Great Depression. In 2009 our government introduced Canada's economic action plan in response to the near-global collapse that took place. This plan sought to stabilize Canadian markets and restore financial security and stability. I do not have time to go through my whole history lesson, but the International Monetary Fund urged that all countries in a position to do so inject fiscal stimulus of 2% of gross domestic product to reduce the effects of a damaging recession. Of course, this meant deficit spending over a period of time until the markets returned to normal. Canada was part of that. We have made some important and right decisions in the past. Since 2006, for instance, the average family of four pays $3,400 less in taxes than it did previously. Today we see that, and it is a result of decisions taken in 2006. My time is up.

As a person who has been a professional educator for 18 years, I have taught every grade in the classroom, from fourth grade to graduate studies at the university level. I have served as a vice-principal and a principal of public schools as well. It is great to be here to support the bill. It is a bill that supports the teaching and education of history to many thousands of Canadians, from one end of this country to another. When we think about the way history is being taught in Canada right now, some improvements are needed. I think it is disgraceful that we have only 3 out of 10 provinces which have the teaching of history as a required course for graduation. That means 7 out of 10 provinces from coast to coast to coast have history courses that are taught basically as an elective. I do not understand how we are going to reach the potential that is Canada, the potential that our nation can achieve, if we do not teach the next generation where we are from and who we are. This needs to change. We all know that teaching and curriculum development is a provincial jurisdiction and mandate, but what can the federal government do to support the education of our young people and the teaching of history in Canada? I think the bill is one step forward to make sure the citizens of Canada, the next generation of Canadians, have a greater opportunity to take a look at Canada and understand who we are and where we come from. If they have a better understanding of that, they will increasingly have a better understanding of who we can be and who we will be and how we are going to reach the great potential that is Canada. The bill is about who we are and who we can be. Whether our ancestors came to Canada across a land bridge from Asia, or they first set foot in North America to exploit our great cod stocks on the Grand Banks, or they established settlements in Annapolis Royal and survived scurvy and, of course, the harsh winters, or whether they built Acadian dikes and established agriculture on the east coast of our country, or they escaped religious intolerance in Europe for more freedom for their beliefs in this country, or they escaped slavery in the United States and escaped to Canada through the Underground Railroad led by great Canadians like Harriet Tubman, or they avoided the potato famine in Ireland and immigrated to Canada, or whether our ancestors, like some of my ancestors and the ancestors of the Minister of National Defence , sailed to Canada on the Hector with the Camerons, the MacNeils, the MacDonalds and the MacKays, or they immigrated to Canada from China to help develop the railway which united this country from coast to coast, or they fled Nazism and the Holocaust in Europe in the thirties and forties, or the totalitarianism and the communism in the Cold War in Eastern Europe, or whether they simply sailed up to our shores as refugees from Vietnam, this museum will stand for all of them. I support this museum and I support this legislation. This is our story. It is a Canadian story. Canada is the world's home. We have accepted Canadians from across this globe who are coming here to seek their fortune, prosperity, and to avoid persecution. They are coming for freedom, to be able to respect the religion and beliefs they want to respect. Canada respects all of these people who immigrated here. We are going to have a museum which reflects that respect, those beliefs, and the history that is Canada. As the second largest nation on the planet, with a relatively small population and vast natural resources, our future is bright. Canada is a beacon of prosperity, and when we look across the world at the economic struggles that many of our neighbours are facing, we truly are a beacon of hope. We truly are a light at the end of the tunnel. Canada is experiencing a better recovery from the greatest depression since the Great Depression of the thirties than any other nation in the G8. Thanks to the leadership of our Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance , we are emerging from that recession in a stronger position than anyone else, positioning our country for greatness for generations to come. This ability to help people coming to Canada, to help people who have lived in Canada for generations, understand where our nation was founded, how we have grown and where we can go is what this museum is all about. That is why I support this museum. People from across the country have to come to our national museums, whether it be Pier 21 in Halifax or whether it be in Ottawa, and see what is contained in their national museums. This museum will work by partnering with museums all across the country, from Terrace, British Columbia to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia to Weyburn, Saskatchewan. Small museums will be able to have artifacts in storage from these large museums. I understand 80% of the artifacts of some museums at any given time are kept in the attic or kept in the basement. We will free those artifacts from the attic. We will free them from the basement. We will move them across the country, so literally thousands and thousands of Canadians, who have never had the opportunity to see these artifacts, to see what the history of this nation truly is, those who would not have the finances to travel from one end of this nation to the other, will be able to experience this in their home town, in their home communities and their home museums will be able to exploit this to help build the resources they need to celebrate their individual culture and history as well. It is a win-win situation for our small museums and for all Canadians across the country. That is why we are putting forward this legislation. That is why this plan will best serve Canadians from coast to coast to coast, whether they are rich or poor, they can see the true Canadian cultural experience right in their home town museums. That is why we support this legislation. That is why Canada, small museums and small communities will prosper from this legislation. What might be contained in some of these communities? What might be able to travel? Artifacts from Marconi's radio, Bell's telephone. We might have something from the Canadarm. We could celebrate great Canadians like Harriet Tugman, as I mentioned before, and the underground railroad, like Adam Beach and Tecumseh, artifacts from the War of 1812, artifacts from the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the great military history we have in Canada. All these things can now in showcases across the country from coast to coast to coast so all Canadians can enjoy them. Canada is a special place, a place that we can all be proud of and a place that we should continuously celebrate. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, if we do not know who we are, if we do not know where we are from, if we do not know how we came to be, how can we achieve the greatness that Canada can be? How can we achieve that potential that every member of Parliament is here to ensure we all achieve together? I am very proud to support this legislation. I am very proud that we are putting this forward. I encourage all members from all parties across the House to get behind our national history museum. Any of us who have travelled to the United States or travelled to the German Museum of History, have seen what kinds of artifacts would be contained in these great national museums. This will be our Smithsonian. This will be our national museum, a Canadian national museum, celebrating great Canadians like Terry Fox, like all the prime ministers who have come before the current Prime Minister , celebrating great Canadians like Banting and Best and all the people who have put forward the scientific achievement that is Canada. I strongly support this legislation. I credit the minister for putting this forward. This will be a true, national treasure for all Canadians to enjoy from coast to coast to coast.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20131128-15738.1.1.46", "topic": "", "role": "government", "speaker": "Chris Alexander", "party": "Conservative", "date": "2013-11-28", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "People can deny, but no one can deny it if they've looked at the facts.

Six years ago, Canada and the world faced an economic crisis unlike any seen in generations, perhaps the worst we had seen since the Great Depression. Rather than hope that the crisis would resolve itself, rather than make glib statements about how budgets balance themselves, we chose to act. We chose to assess the problem, develop a concrete action plan, and take strong action. We chose to invest in much-needed infrastructure as a time-limited stimulus. This action plan put our neighbours to work. It built for our community, certainly in the GTA, roads, bridges, water pipes, and community centres. I was young and determined and led my community, the sixth-largest city in our country, to match the Prime Minister 's leadership and undertake an ambitious building plan. Today the GTA stands as the beneficiary of that much-needed infrastructure. This past weekend, in fact, a neighbour of mine who used a swimming pool that generously carries my name on a bronze plaque at the front entrance shared with me how her family has used that pool each and every week for years. Results speak for themselves, and Canada has led the world in pulling out of the recession and rebuilding prosperity. However, back then there were many naysayers. There were quite a few so-called experts, some advocating that we should hoard money and take it out of the money supply. We understood that was not the prudent course. We chose to show leadership and make time-limited investments immediately, investments that would be needed to be built anyway. Those investments would be accelerated by a few years, and we could plow the money back into the Canadian economy and put our neighbours to work. In fact, we could save dollars, because we would not be competing at some future date with the private sector and ramping up the costs for steel and concrete. We could instead choose to invest the money immediately and potentially save taxpayers some money. Canada's economic action plan invested billions of dollars into local communities to strengthen Canada's infrastructure and promote local business investment. These investments were necessary to position Canada to strengthen and weather the storm. However, even during those challenging economic days of 2008, even as our government stood firm on its commitment to returning Canada's finances back to balance by 2015, even then there were many skeptics who doubted it was possible\u2014yet look at where we are today. Today I am proud to stand before all members of the House to indicate that we expect to be back to balance on time, as promised by our great Minister of Finance . In fact, under economic action plan 2014, our government's deficit will be eliminated, and a surplus of over $6 billion is anticipated. It is important to put this into perspective. Thanks to the stewardship of our Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , our government made some challenging but responsible choices. We have reduced wasteful and redundant government and we have reduced spending by some $9 billion through prudent fiscal management and administrative efficiencies. Balanced budgets promote stability, business investment, confidence, and lower taxes. Most importantly, they protect families. Unlike what happened under the Liberal government of the 1990s, the fiscal recovery in Canada has not been, and will not be, borne on the backs of hard-working families and future generations. To be clear, we have not cut health transfers to the provinces. In fact, what we have done through these most challenging economic times is honoured our word and increased transfers to the provinces. By the end of the decade, they will reach an historic $40 billion. My family, my mother, and my children rely on our health care system, as do all Canadians, and Conservatives are firm and committed to the priorities of average middle-class Canadians. Economic action plan 2014 continues to build upon our government's strong record of supporting everyday Canadians. Budget 2014 will further improve the quality of life for Canadian families by expanding access to vital services, increasing consumer protection, reducing taxes, and, most importantly, promoting job growth. For example, we will further enhance employment insurance sickness benefits for parental benefit claimants. Beginning this year, people who receive benefits to care for critically ill parents will receive enhanced access to sickness benefits. Disproportionately, the challenge of taking care of family members seems to fall to women, so I am very proud of our government's initiative on this front. Similarly, economic action plan 2014 will continue supporting families who seek to grow through adoption. In recognition of the many expenses related to the adoption process, our budget will enhance the adoption expense tax credit up to $15,000 per child. These measures outlined in our budget build upon our record of putting families first, and since 2006, our Conservative government has taken many steps to improve the quality of life for Canadians of all ages. For example, in 2006 and since then, we have reduced the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%. That saves Canadians money every single day, every time they make a purchase. Our government also established the tax-free savings account, strengthening Canadians' ability to save for their future. We have introduced dozens of new tax credits to help stretch the family budget even further, initiatives like the universal child care benefit, the family caregiver tax credit, the textbook tax credit, and the public transit tax credit. As I indicated earlier today, I am the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health , and we are vitally focused on the health and safety of all Canadians. I am pleased to report that this budget will invest more in Canada's world-class health care system while keeping Canadians safe and well. Canada has one of the finest health care systems in the world. We expect the best from our health care professionals and they expect the best from us. That is why our government is sending more health transfers back to the provinces than any government before. These investments will ensure that the provinces and territories have the necessary capacity to deliver vital medical services to Canadians when they need it the most. Another area of prime importance is Canada's food supply system. This budget will invest almost $400 million in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to further enhance food safety. We all have a shared goal of ensuring that the food we purchase from grocery shelves and place before our families at the kitchen table is safe. We will invest $153 million to strengthen the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's food safety information programs. We will provide funding to hire 200 new food inspectors, and we will invest almost $31 million to establish a food safety information network so that we can link provincial bodies together to increase safety and our knowledge of hazardous events. The health and safety of Canadians is not limited to the food we eat; it includes the communities in which we live. I am proud that this budget has considered the important work of my committee and will invest almost $45 million to combat prescription drug abuse across Canada. Sadly, prescription drug abuse is a growing danger in Canadians' lives and sometimes targets the most vulnerable in our society. Prescription drug abuse has effects on all segments, all ages, from seniors to adults to teens and even very young children, and many families are forced to suffer in silence without adequate resources to support them or their loved ones. As a government and as a society, it is our responsibility to ensure that these individuals and their families are protected and have access to programs to help them cope with these very difficult challenges. By investing in and expanding the national anti-drug strategy, we will ensure that Canadians and their families are properly supported. It is not only dangers from prescription drug abuse that I am concerned about. A growing number of individuals are becoming addicted and are dependent on illicit drugs such as heroin. Our government has taken concrete, strong action to ensure that we do not continue their addictions, but instead, that we intervene and try to help these people back to a drug-free life. I am pleased that our Minister of Health and our Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness have taken decisive action to keep our streets safe from dangerous narcotics. Through the introduction of Bill C-2 respect for communities act, which I spoke to earlier this session, we will help protect Canadians from the dangers of illegal drugs, including those who struggle with drug addiction. In a nutshell, I believe that economic action plan 2014 strikes a much needed balance between balancing our books, paying down the debt, and making the crucial investments that average hard-working Canadians have come to expect from our government.", "matching_links": false}, {"id": "ca.proc.d.20140210-15819.4.23.1", "topic": "Oral Questions", "role": "mp", "speaker": "Bruce Hyer", "party": "Green Party", "date": "2014-02-10", "house": null, "categories": [], "text": "Mr. Speaker, let us look at some facts of life under the Minister of Finance : unemployment is up 9%, youth unemployment is even worse, real economic growth per capita is the lowest since the Great Depression, and personal and national debt are both up by over 25%.
