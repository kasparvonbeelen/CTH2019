I agree that there is politics in the music business and that you have traversed it very well to date but some of your positions are off base. Men are a bit &#39;unusual&#39; and the music business loves it because it sells but women being unusual sells even more but makes you more competitors with women. and as to the joke, it may be old but it keeps happening. Old or not there is truth to it.	UC819GQZxfOQNKNXKgLrEl7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC819GQZxfOQNKNXKgLrEl7A	0

Don&#39;t tell me about her charitable giving or opportunities to be concerned and talking to the poor or homeless , or her having real people over her house . All that is just a piss in the bucket for her . Like all 9 figure millionaires and billionaires she can pay tax lawyers millions a year to avoid paying taxes and still have hundreds of millions left over . She is a multinational corporation , a fat cat no better than Jamie Dimon , Gates, Lebron james(yes i said it , he is all about money) , Ken Lay, Bernie Madoff , Michael Jordan, Warren Buffett(another wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing like swift), and swift is no better than the robber barons of the past like JP Morgan, the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Gould, Carnegie, etc . Once she stops letting investment bankers invest in the military industrial complex, Nike, etc and pays her fair share in progressive income tax, then and only then will we consider her a genuine artist .

So don&#39;t feel bad about the bad mouthers. Feel inspired that u don&#39;t lower to their level, and keep on ur path which inspires everyone around, a good friend of mine called me &quot;in sol&quot;...youre a starrr!!!!! GUess what? Good people need one another. Barbara Walters&#39; persona is so reporters...she cools and warms interviews at will.....grrr :P Mrs. Walters probably enjoys playing mind games w u since her mother-li(e) figure on t.v. is wide as an ocean, its called the halo effect by psychologists, n theyre the no. 1 subscriber of it, with all the b3sts	UCcO3R0HD6iI_wqiWetqO6mQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcO3R0HD6iI_wqiWetqO6mQ	0

I'm guessing that they didn't bash identifiable ex-girlfriends (certainly not Sam Smith). I think Lena Dunham pretended to be Taylor Swift's friend so that her boyfriend could work with Taylor Swift.

It‚Äôs weird to me that so many people don‚Äôt like her. I think she‚Äôs so good at being herself. She‚Äôs very good at managing her life and conducting herself. Everybody presents themselves to the word in some way and the fact that she presents herself as a good, collected, strong, hard working person, says that she was nourished with self esteem somewhere in her life and I think it was from her parents.

So many of my young students talk about waiting until marriage and use celebrities like Taylor Swift, Tim Tebow and other celebrities who also waited as their role models. They are now taking the stand that Virginity is cool! I smile when I hear these conversations; they make me very proud!

She is an AI robotics project codenamed TAYLOR, developed in collaboration with record industry executives and tumblr. Originally she was only test marketed in rural America, but she was so successful they expanded her into New York, the rest of the US, and then internationally.

Some of them are about life, friendship, about her band, about criticisms. The important fact is she may write songs about anything but they all are fu*king awesome.(I&#39;m sorry to use that word). So that&#39;s her talent. Her talent should not be someone to joke. That&#39;s why I laugh at those haters for not having a point and acts like they have.

You guys don&#39;t have to agree with me but you can at least hear me out and take it into consideration. Why do y&#39;all hate on Taylor&#39;s songs? If they were so bad then they wouldn&#39;t have been sold to millions! If she didn&#39;t write about how she feels in her songs then what&#39;s the purpose of writing them at all? We wouldn&#39;t know who she is and it would be boring listening to dull music. Furthermore she wouldn&#39;t be famous either because it&#39;s the people who relate to singers by listening to the singers experiences in life through their music. Therefore everyone can get to know their STORY, relate to them, know what they&#39;ve been through and how they became the person they are today. Without emotions in the music then what would it be? Just cold plain beats that no one would like to listen to nor feel anything by listening to it... I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s the truth and some people don&#39;t like to hear it.

You can call her "overrated" but name another female pop artist who can actually write ENTIRE ALBUMS ALL BY THEMSELVES. Not even Adele or Sia does that (yes, I said it). Her voice is not as Carey's or Houston's but yet she can hit 15 sec notes and her impact worldwide is just HUGE + her music is PURE GOLD. You may dislike her but don't pretend she's untalented nor overrated just because.	UCnUSF2-f8jVqIV6UTdRNyig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUSF2-f8jVqIV6UTdRNyig	1	Ugit1yl4yMUwpngCoAEC	kennedymeow

It&#39;s always the same too, &quot;she&#39;s ice cold, she&#39;s a bitch, she&#39;s greedy,&quot; and there&#39;s never ANY justification to back up these claims because it doesn&#39;t exist. Yes, she came from a very privileged upbringing and for that it was easier to make her way into the music industry. So you&#39;re mad cause she didn&#39;t grow up poor? Get over it. She has integrity, an immense amount of talent, beauty, quirkiness and by the looks of it some of you can&#39;t handle that. Maybe redirect that negative energy at working on your own lives instead of slamming her because she has a great life. Grow up.

UgjGCmlHbtLgh3gCoAEC	11	6	2016-10-15 10:00:24	James Calhoun	Taylor Swift is the fakest person in the music industry. Answering scripted questions so that her pathetic fans can see how &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;relatable&quot; she is. You all know she didn&#39;t attend high school like you did, right? Her dad is richer than Robert Kardashian and Bruce Jenner. From a young age she was trained in writing catchy lyrics that appeal to the demographic with the most disposable income -- teenage and young adult girls. She is a product of a corporate music label, that was built to manipulate young girls into buying her music. Taylor Swift is a brand that is constantly being maintained by Big Machine&#39;s PR team. There is nothing wrong with being a fan. Just realize that if you are a fan, you are not a fan of the woman in this video, but the fan of a brand that is comprised of dozens of people that are manipulating you from afar. Remember, this is all an act. Taylor Swift, as you know her, is not real.	UCLyNCYNcJRrr24qc7zNOA8g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyNCYNcJRrr24qc7zNOA8g	0

It&#39;s 100% due to the fact that she as an individual dates other celebrities and then writes songs about them. ...and she is from a country OBSESSED with celebrities. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s ok to bash her for it. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not sexism.

It's because y'all haters are calling Taylor perfect when her fans don't think that way. People committed and will always commit mistakes no matter what happens. But it seems like no matter how big or small mistakes that Taylor has done, y'all will still judge her and call her snake when in fact we all commit the same mistakes that she has done! Please grab some respect and remember that Taylor Swift is just a freakin human like you who has a feelings, who has a right to commit mistakes, who has a right to write songs about anything that she wants, who has a right to be sad and hurt and every single right that you have. Stop being judgemental and don't spread negativity. If you don't like someone, just keep it that way! Keep your thoughts in your mind and again dont spread negative vibes. And learn how to respect.

People who say that they &quot;miss the old Taylor&quot; I get what they mean but people have a right to change and develop. She was only fifteen when se became famous, you can&#39;t expect a young girl with that kind of lifestyle to stay the same forever. I think her character is still the same... As for Miley Cyrus you know, people always say they wish she was still the old Miley but she became famous with her ROLE as Hannah Montana and not as Miley herself.. And she was even younger than Taylor.. I can only imagine what it must be like to go through puberty and just not have a normal life and have no privacy whatsoever.. But that&#39;s how I see it, I know a lot of people will disagree. Anyway I love Taylor and I think she has a great personality.

To just lump quite a complex issue in with &quot;sexism. Men, in their primal sense are more emotionally closed and meet hardship with aggression so when they express fragility via an art form it really is refreshing. Women, in their primal sense are naturally more open and fragile/volatile - we expect it of a woman, so the arts are already designed as an outlet for this openness and it comes as no surprise when a woman makes emotional work. I&#39;m convinced this is why the majority of &quot;well known&quot; artists across all artistic disciplines are men. It takes a lot for a woman to REFINE her emotions into an art form. Bjork is a good example. Taylor Swift gets jokes about being unhinged because she&#39;s yet to refine her craft.	UCGGaYE-2OjOniy9D0QQwKpw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGGaYE-2OjOniy9D0QQwKpw	0

She hasn't given real thought to what she is saying, but she has an agenda; rather, the Taylor Swift brand has an agenda. How can she call anything sexist when her songs consistently feature female characters that fit the stereotypical young, emotional girl. Her songs are meaningful to so many young girls because she exploits their stereotypes. She is a smart lyricist, because instead of saying what she feels, she makes a pretty damn good guess at what the typical teenage girl would feel. She wasn't a typical teenage girl, so she doesn't know, so she has to rely on sexist stereotypes. And since all stereotypes come from a place of consistent truth, her strategy is successful; rather, the Taylor Swift brand's strategy is successful.

Is the world to assume that &quot;Tay&quot; has no boy fans? Isn&#39;t this action just reverse sexism from her position? Tell us <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MsSwift">#MsSwift</a> which is it, are we trying to end sexism all together or just promote female chauvinism?

If a girl dates lots of guys, she&#39;s a &#39;slut&#39;. <br />She&#39;s slut shamed and body shamed every single day and that&#39;s perfectly okay just because &#39;all she writes about is her boyfriends&#39;.

UghFBE4FKbF9gXgCoAEC	1	3	2015-09-05 23:13:14	Sophie K	The reason she&#39;s such a phenomenon is because of her lyrics. It&#39;s because she writes her own songs. Her songs speak to her fans. I remember when she was just starting out and nobody really knew about her yet. It&#39;s crazy to see what a mega star she&#39;s become. I do think it&#39;s gotten to her head though. &quot;Crowds literally follow me everywhere. I always need security. I&#39;ve needed security for five years.&quot; While that may be true, it&#39;s the way she says things like that which makes her seem a little egotistical. God forbid she has a nervous breakdown. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me just because she&#39;s peaked at such a young age.	UCUVVd1YCwwiWP1t_bKqqS2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVVd1YCwwiWP1t_bKqqS2Q	0

America is all about the money and the profit. They produce artists that are so manufactured to make money. They don't even need to be all that talented, just have that star appeal and an average voice and they'll do the rest. Rihanna, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, etc all the faces of a label money making machine. Britain and Ireland however produce artists that are nothing like this. Adele, Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, Florence Welch, Emilia Sande, Hozier. All artists that are just simple ordinary day people but with great talented and skill. All with their own sound and style in music. In no way manufactured, just themselves. I'm not saying labels in the UK don't care about money, they do but they rely on the old method of finding artists that will sell because their appeal as artists rather than their appeal as sex symbols, or pop stars. The US has produced great artists but that's not what the focus is on anymore. It's on money.

I mean seriously. What grade are you in again? Just to give an opinion you don't need to bring another artist in the story. This video is about Taylor. If you wanted to see a video about Adele or Sia or Mariah Carey then you should've gone to see a video about them. No offense but if you have to bring someone down just to show someone is good, or if you have to bring a completely unrelated person to an argument which is clearly not about them in any ways then you're a really bad debater. And your argument no longer holds any good material. Sorry not sorry, life is hard sweetie- better get used to the harsh critical people and I mean, you should know all about it.

I could have found loads more but I really don't have the patience to correct people who are really way too presumptuous and cocky, especially when they have no idea what they are talking about. Let me tell you little something, you don't need to be someone's brother or 'close friend' to know them. Maybe since you're a heartless asshole you know nothing about love or caring for someone but other's do. You're not the only one in this big world genius. At least they have done their research and know what they are talking about, unlike you. If someone is rude to someone tell me you won't stand up for the victim. Actually bad question... I don't think cowards would stand up for anyone in any case. Back to my point though, defending someone is not a bad thing darling. You just need to learn to shut up in some scenarios where you are not required AT ALL.

Comparing one artist to another is really not appropriate in this situation. Sure, if this video was called 'Taylor Swift or Adele?' or if it were called 'Is Taylor Swift the best singer?' then I would understand why some people would be arguing but over here it makes no sense. You really don't need to bring someone down to show another person is better. Both Taylor and Adele are extremely talented singers but you don't need to compare them in this instance. Adele may appeal to a bigger audience but why on earth do we need to compare her to Taylor? Just to show that Taylor is not good? I don't think it's necessary and it is definitely not appropriate.

I don't mean to be offensive (or maybe I do) but you sound like a complete and absolute idiot. I'm not trying to say that you AREN'T an idiot but you do sound like one. So please do hear some songs, talk to more people, people who will confirm that Taylor does indeed have songs for all generations. And if you don't like socialising and people are not your thing (I do wonder what IS your thing) which is not going to be a surprise for I can't think of anyone who would want to be your friend, then listen to someone her music and then make a proper judgment based on the songs and not your own prejudices. Maybe listening to the lyrics would make you realise the deeper meanings behind the songs and turn your one dimensional world into something more appropriate.

I'd say McCartney + Lennon, and Stevie Wonder are still more prolific, plus some guys that aren't singers like Max Martin. Also hate to say it, but R Kelly might be too, he's had load of hits and almost never used co-writers. Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey definitely have loads of hits like Taylor, but I don't know enough about them to say how much of the song-writing credit should go to them vs their co-writers and producers.

She achieved stardom thanks to the songs she wrote when she was 11-17 years old. It's not like she achieved stardom first and used that as a platform to sell her songs after the fact. Her record label was also tiny until her songs blew up, much less of a major label than Motown.

Don't forget it was easier to get a #1 hit in the 60s-80s (even 90s to a lesser extent) because most big hits only charted 10-15 weeks. Having songs chart for 36 weeks (Our Song) or 48 weeks (Teardrops On My Guitar) and not even hit the top 10 would be completely unheard of back then. Love Story (49 weeks), You Belong With Me (50 weeks) and I Knew You Were Trouble (36 weeks) would have almost certainly been #1 hits back then, and likely so would Wildest Dreams (27 weeks) and Style (32 weeks). The Beatles only had one song that charted for over 20 weeks (Twist And Shout) while Taylor Swift has had 32 such songs. If you look at how dominant an artist has been on the Hot 100 by taking into account both peak and length of chart run, ex each week at #1 is 250 points, at #10 is 100 points, at #90 is 10 points... Taylor Swift is up there with the greats. So are Drake and Rihanna, but they aren't as involved in the writing of their songs. If you split the points for each songs among all the co-writers, Drake and Rihanna drop down the rankings a lot but although Taylor takes a bit of a hit for having 1-2 co-writers on several of her popular songs, she's still up there and she's only 28 so I'm sure she'll get more hits.

Ughod2cerqSQ7ngCoAEC.83imNuS86R38k_ikWcUkEy		0	2018-08-30 18:16:37	Nicolas Derome	I think having successful hits without the backing of a major record label or without the platform that comes with being a Disney star or established celebrity is a pretty impressive accomplishment. For example Love Story and Our Song. I suspect you can give her most of the credit for Teardrops On My Guitar and You Belong With Me since her co-writer admitted her role was mostly to encourage Taylor to open up about what she was thinking and then act like an editor. Although those 4 hits didn't reach #1 on the Hot 100, that's because they had very long chart runs rather than explosive ones. Our Song spent 6 weeks at #1 on Country Radio airplay, which was previously accomplished by Carrie Underwood in 2006, and took until at least 2012 before being accomplished again (the chart data gets weird after 2012). Teardrops On My Guitar was one of the biggest country-pop cross-over hits of that decade. That got blown out of the water by Love Story and You Belong With Me, which I think you'd have to go back to the 80s to find a song that crossed over as successfully. In 2009, Love Story was the most played of all songs on radio, and You Belong With Me was #2. None of her Max Martin hits charted quite as high on the year end radio songs charts, Blank Space only reached #5 in 2015, and I Knew You Were Trouble #9 in 2013. Love Story and You Belong With Me also made her the most played artist on Adult Contemporary radio in 2009, which is a category of mostly radio stations that are known for catering to 25-44 year old white females, so they weren't just popular among teens. And yeah, Speak Now has good songwriting even though it didn't have as big hits as Fearless. I'm struggling to think of an album released this century written entirely by the singer that has had even 10% of Speak Now's sales. Max Martin definitely did have an influence in giving some of her singles that commercial mainstream pop appeal, but I think they both benefited from working with each other. His collaborations with weaker song-writers often have weaker lyrics since Max Martin is Swedish and English isn't his first language, his main strength is to make the songs sound catchy. I also don't know how many of his other songs have the playful turns of phrase and theatrics a lot of his collabs with Taylor Swift have, or even little unique touches like using Taylor's heart-beat as the beat for Wildest Dreams, or the pen-click in Blank Space. Many song-writers have had their greatest success when working with another artist with complimentary talents so I don't think it's a big deal that Taylor Swift collaborated with Max Martin when you have John Lennon + Paul McCartney, Bono + The Edge, Michael Jackson + Quincy Jones, Mick Jagger + Keith Richards, etc. But yes, although Max Martin's approach is very structured and formulaic, he does deserve credit for being the one that perfected that formula to have possibly the most hits of any song-writer.

I mean, they only "polished" the song but without their help her songs wouldn't be that ranked up. I think she shows good song writing on her Speak Now album but usually her non-singles are way better than her singles. Her career must last for at least another 10 to consider her a memorable artist. I could list a few artists that had more number one hits than her. In my opinion she has enough talent and I really like some of her songs, mainly her non-singles such as All Too Well or Dear John.

That kind of sexism is still very much alive in the music industry because Taylor Swift sang about her exes and got more hate than Robin Thicke got for singing about rape. And she still gets hate for singing about her feelings while any other male artist with feelings can sing about whatever he wants and walk away with no problem. It&#39;s disgusting.

"You're my best friend." And you knew what it was He is in love You can hear it in the silence, silence You can feel it on the way home, way home You could see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love And so it goes You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words 'Cause you can hear it in the silence You can feel it on the way home You could see it with the lights out You are in love, true love You're in love You can hear it in the silence, silence You can feel it on the way home, way home You could see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love You're in love You can hear it in the silence, silence You can feel it on the way home, way home You can see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love You're in love	UCwce6TEfk3o-AUdCE_gvJww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwce6TEfk3o-AUdCE_gvJww	1	Ugj6SgjOWjKQJ3gCoAEC	eternal m0nk

Some people do it for the thrill or the rush, some just want to conquer it all in a sense of accomplishment. She may not want the fame, money, or fans but just wants to be on the top. Unequivocally on top to the point no one can stand or say anything against her. She's ruling without fear. That's a boss mentality. Many bosses, I.E. crime bosses in the world rule others with fear so you cannot say or do anything against them out of fear of reprisal (Taylor is not a criminal btw.) And that is a how they rule, this has been shown throughout history time and time again. She has that mentality. But she does it in a way of using others and bringing others on her side and if you are against her then you are against everyone. In this industry that is power. A HUGE amount of power and if anyone goes against that she can crush them without having to directly do it herself. Like I said, very very smart girl. If she wasn't a singer and grew up in a downtrodden area then she would be dangerous. She seems like someone that will do whatever it takes to win but make it seem like it's not the case at all. You don't rise in this industry, make the friends you do, have the connections you have and conquer in this way without having some skill. Open your eyes, this isn't just some young innocent little girl she's a strong minded, determined, dangerous little lady in a dress who is going to be around for a long time. People like her don't come along very often but here is the other thing about "bosses" in the world. Once they fall, even in the slightest, every enemy that you have, don't have, would have, will come to crush you and make sure you never rise again. History, look it up, it's all in there. It repeats itself and in this case, just a different form. So once again, watch out Taylor, be careful, and good luck. But yes, she is fake, but who isn't in this world. Just her level of fake is scary. Look out.	UCGjq0vQDjyTrI-rBvyi3vBg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGjq0vQDjyTrI-rBvyi3vBg	1	UggPNPIVDjx6y3gCoAEC	karenKristal

She's getting all these stars on her side not because she's "sincere", there's more to it than that in this industry. She's smart and she knows it.

I don&#39;t know why I hated her. (Nvm I do remember lol it was because she dated Harry styles and well I was in that phase of liking one direction. I still kinda ) anyways I just realized how this young lady is so successful. I started searching her up and realizing how she writes her own songs. She is so talented. For starters she is classy not trashy look at her choice of fashion. It&#39;s girly and classy and that&#39;s what I love. She covers up but look at her videos!! She has 1 billion views. (In which she deserves) I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this but Taylor swift you prove me wrong and you have all my respect !!

I've listened to most of her songs, without being too big of a Taylor fan... The lyrics are smart, but honestly she's stuck in high school no doubt about that for me. On a positive note, I think if she wrote a novel herself, it would go REALLY well.

According to the media, everytime a female celebrity talks to a male celebrity, or a male celeb talks to a female celeb, BAM. They're dating. If you really look at who Taylor's dated, she's only been with around 6 guys over the course of 10 years, which I'd say is a pretty average number these days. And how do we know whether or not she's actually been in love? We don't. She barely speaks about her relationships, only sings about them, and her lyrics are deep and meaningly, at least more meaningful than "Don't want none unless you got buns hun" and "First thing's first, I'm the realest". I'd say her and Ed Sheeran are two of the biggest artists who actually make their career off meaningful music.

She could tell a story through her lyrics, and that's what I love about country music - there's usually a story being told. Now that she's pop, quite a few of her songs don't do that, but there are still a couple off her new album that do, like "How You Get the Girl" and "Wildest Dreams". Her older stuff was deep and no, she did not write only break up songs. Have I gotten more about love from a book like Pride and Prejudice or a Nicholas Sparks novel than I have from her lyrics? Of course. But it's the way that she conveys her message that's powerful, and she's able to convey it pretty strongly in the space of 3 minutes, and that's what makes her so successful.

Her lyrics have little wisdom on life that I could not have found by reading one romance novel 2.The "love" she sings about is shallow, based on her lyrics, she's only experienced relationships and the novelty of them, not love. Love is.. so much more where you don't simply break up with the person or have a list of people you "loved". ¬†It's like shallow friends where you have a list of friends that used to be there and the list of friends that have ALWAYS had you're back. Once Taylor figures this out in a couple of decades, maybe she'll write about something more wise.¬†	UCD2uxv51Dzbnnv99QJNSSQQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD2uxv51Dzbnnv99QJNSSQQ	1	UghXVsNUB_jMjHgCoAEC	D Lo

She has had one or two dates with the guys she then trashes in her songs. Since when is it "cool" to air your dirty laundry in song I mean public? She is so overrated and most of her songs sound the same. Listen to a bunch of her songs in succession and you will see what I mean.

It was such a beautiful song and deserved more credit than it got, but she's written songs like Sweeter than Fiction, which is a catchy up-beat pop-tune (similar to the ones off her Red album), yet it also went under the radar. Ronan did receive quite a bit of attention at the time, but I do agree that her catchier tunes with lyrics that aren't as deep have received more, not as deserved, attention. But that doesn't take away from the fact that she is able to write lyrics at an incredibly high standard. But the things she sings about, such as love, I don't find them shallow at all. I've never been in love, but when I listen to her songs, I can honestly feel like I can understand what she went through on an emotional level, and it's rare that music does that today.

On top of that, they're catchy songs.¬†That's why soooo many people go to her concerts, the lyrics are broad and apply to many because they are shallow ideas. Even if the song tells specific stories, the idea still applies to everyone essentially. One Taylor song that I enjoyed that has some substance is her song Ronan that she wrote a while back. I felt since the song was written in the grieving mother's perspective, it showed a lot of intelligence on Taylor's part in creating the mother's story in a beautiful way. Of course, that song wasn't as popular because the idea didn't apply to many audiences nor was it happy nor was it catchy.¬†	UCD2uxv51Dzbnnv99QJNSSQQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD2uxv51Dzbnnv99QJNSSQQ	1	UghXVsNUB_jMjHgCoAEC	D Lo

Particularly with her earlier country music, songs like "Tim McGraw" "Our Song" and her later country-pop stuff like "The Lucky One" and "All too Well" had lyrics that really made you stop and if you understood the meaning behind the song, then you understood why she chose those words to convey her music. I genuinely believe she deserves he title of one of the best lyricists of the new generation because, let's face it, people aren't going to her concerts to hear her voice. They go to hear those lyrics and connect with her songs.	UC2bCwCCBWR2KPW3VEysHDfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2bCwCCBWR2KPW3VEysHDfQ	1	UghXVsNUB_jMjHgCoAEC	D Lo

But by no means are the lyrics stimulating or thought provoking or even well thought out. She knows how to write catchy tunes, but the lyrics are all shallow thoughts. For example, smart lyrics are like Eminem's song When I'm Gone. I actually felt something based on his clever simulation of words and imagination. I was freakin moved by the creativity. I like Taylor also, but her lyrics are NOT smart or wise or anything above high school or even middle school content.

Listen to her songs like: Back to December, All too Well, Breathe, Clean, Mine, Last Kiss, Red..the list goes on and on and that's why she's one of the youngest people to be inaugurated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Yeah, some of her mainstream songs are much more simplified but don't belittle her talent if you haven't listened to her albums in full. - Music industry experts didn't name her "one of pops finest writers" for nothing.

Taylor on the other hand, being a woman, complains about how &quot;shitty&quot; men are and how they&#39;ve fucked her over. So yeah maybe that is where sexism comes in to play. Maybe if ALL song writers were to sing about positive relationships they&#39;ve had there wouldn&#39;t be sexism in that industry. But then again Taylor wouldn&#39;t be the Taylor she is if she presented herself as a woman pleased with the male species. Oh and she definitely wouldn&#39;t be making bank either.

This is most probably a pointless venture, BUT if there is the tiniest possibility of receiving ANYTHING from this truly wonderful young woman I want to try. I don&#39;t want this interpreted as a sob-story but, the fact is I have an incurable disease called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I should&#39;ve died years ago. I have been in a wheelchair since I was 8, I&#39;ve had double pneumonia which nearly killed me, I have an internal defibrillator and a tube in my stomach as I can&#39;t swallow food. But I am grateful for every day and happy to fight to be alive.¬†<br /><br />I hope to get enough &#39;likes&#39; and/or &#39;shares&#39; to be noticed by the lovely Taylor or her management to notice. A message would make my year, a visit my decade. No joke. Swifties are generous, can you help me with this dream? Thank you.

She is a good one, but compare her to Bob Dylan for example and there's a huge difference. The Beatles have revolutionized the music industry with pop music. Taylor's peak was 1989, but I don't think it was her last one. Don't get me wrong but I would choose your words carefully.

She has family, money, fame, beauty, health, friends and influence. Many people won&#39;t even get one of them for their whole life.<br />Usually we are NOT that perfect. It makes people feel lost and envy.<br />How teens every learn how to overcome severe difficulties from a person who hasn&#39;t had a BIG one in her life?

I see celebrities who have been through incredible trials and worked their asses off to get to where they are, like Timomatic who broke his neck and bounced back to be an awesome performer, dancing like it never happened. And I wonder why he isn't more famous and adored than, say, Justin Bieber or One Direction or even Usher. What is it people are attracted to in stars? Is it the sense that they're invincible and their lives are perfect? Maybe it's just another form of escapism because we're dissatisfied with our lives and seek solace in immersing ourselves in the glorified life of another. I wish we could have a JK Rowling of the music industry; someone with talent who's also had it tough (like Elvis for example). I think that would be truly inspirational. (And one concert I'd be sure to get tickets to). :-)	UCorWiiSmtG8Q2z2MF3gbIKA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorWiiSmtG8Q2z2MF3gbIKA	1	UgjPkNfLvk_1ingCoAEC	Caroline Peng

Honestly a lot of female artists write songs about their exes, Swift is made fun of because the way she goes about it is annoying and if you&#39;ve heard the multiple accounts of how bizarre she acts when she likes a guy you&#39;d understand.

I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve finally stepped down from your many roles at this station. Good riddance! Nobody will care about your new program on Investigation Discovery, either, except your die hard supporters. You will soon disappear from relevancy just like Oprah did after she started OWN (we all know how that turned out).<br /><br />Taylor, on the other hand, should just learn to keep her big fat mouth shut sometimes. How ignorant of her here. Although I liked some of her older music from time to time, she has since turned into a big fake these days, continually portraying herself as the victim in every failed relationship of hers. I highly doubt that. Now she likes to think that she knows everything about how to live your life or how all men these days are evil sharks. News flash Taylor, feminists like you fail to realize that there are evil women out there, too. It&#39;s apparent to me that she&#39;s never heard of the term &quot;She-Devil.&quot;<br /><br />This girl&#39;s whole career runs on hype. The question is, however, just how much longer will it last? Hopefully not as long as Walters&#39; lengthy career in journalism.

Life isn&#39;t either for any celebrity. She has cameras following her, flashes in her face 24/7 and people say she&#39;s a bad person. Put yourself in her shoes. She gives and gives. One day she might just say screw everyone and stop. But I guess you don&#39;t know why you have until it&#39;s gone.

I myself had no gripe she was doing my gripe was why could she not release country album and then record many of the songs as pop to please both. I only like her country stuff. I don;t get the whole thing of the past. She says like i am influenced by country artists, I donate so much music to the country music hall of fame etc and then she wants to turn her back on the genre which made her. I kinda wish the new stuff would fail so she knew it was a bad move but that hasn&#39;t happened and the worse thing now is she has likely made new fans and if she goes back to country she might loose the new fans. I am a big country music fan so i usually hate artists to explore new music. I look at Kelly Clarkson as a good example because she is pop and she turned some of her songs into country versions too (very good) but she didn;t fully say i am going to do country and alienate my fans. Taylor should have done it. But i guess as she says she will shake it off all the bad things people say about her now. I am just saying my view. I like her, but i only like her country stuff as the rest stinks.¬†	UCpOUQRFtNWdziYiW_5eloTg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpOUQRFtNWdziYiW_5eloTg	0

Does she even have any concept of what young people are like nowadays? We&#39;re talking about a woman who grew up in an era when Non-Whites and Women weren&#39;t even allowed to vote. It&#39;s exactly the same when I watch David Letterman trying to flirt or be witty/charming with young celebrities on his show. It&#39;s cringe-worthy. I understand tradition and all that jazz, but come on! I feel like a mummy from ancient Egypt is trying to interview a 19 yr old girl, which makes absolutely no sense to me. Whatever. That&#39;s just my opinion. She also looks like she got a hella ton of plastic surgery or several pounds of makeup on, maybe even possibly being held up by hidden wires, so she won&#39;t fall over and croak.

She is successful because she has the blonde hair and blue eye All American look so the media hypes her up but I like Katy and Rihanna more. Their music is more entertaining and they aren&#39;t just another blonde hair blue eyed All American girl. She just looks like the conservative look that old school America prefer but their isn&#39;t anything special about her. She isn&#39;t even up there with Madonna or even Janet Jackson were. They reached a lot higher of a peak and created a lot more excitement then she has. She isn&#39;t even as big as Brittany Spears was. OVER HYPED BY THE MEDIA...THAT&#39;S ALL IT IS AND IT&#39;S TIME FOR SOME PEOPLE TO SPEAK UP ABOUT IT. ¬†Other singers are afraid to say anything about the All American entertainer but we all know the truth. I do like her new song but her music seems to much for the high school virgin. She&#39;s too innocent and seems to straight too. She also seems to worried about what other females will think about her that she doesn&#39;t ever say anything she seems to think. I prefer someone stronger and with more personality..more honesty. She just simply looks the part.¬†	UCv8O2eXwiMetfyHBPrpotUw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv8O2eXwiMetfyHBPrpotUw	0

I said she has composed her songs because her melodies have always been simple up until her last two albums that have more upbeat pop songs and I also mentioned that she has minimal knowledge of these instruments which in no way makes her a musician. I also never said her music was special in comparison to other females. I do think she writes her own songs though. I think you are only looking at the songs that are her singles such as "We Are Never Getting Back Together" or "Shake It Off" that are her most simple lyrics but have you actually gone through some of her albums to actually see what she is capable of lyrically without just judging by her singles? Again, I already said I agreed with your OP that states everything about her being marketable. Whether she is a good songwriter or not, I have noticed her fans like her specifically for the reasons you claimed and they use her songwriting as a way to justify it so I understand where you are coming from. I however don't agree that when it comes to actually writing songs, that she doesn't do a lot on her own up until recently since now she is in the pop world where all that matters is if her songs are catchy and repetitive. I never said she is superior to any of the people you have mentioned because I think Taylor lacks a lot that she makes up for with being the "All American Girl" like you have claimed.¬†	UCy5rBn6E1ykRuAirGeoMwwg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5rBn6E1ykRuAirGeoMwwg	1	UgiJwxgC4ybNiHgCoAEC	John Vu

That's like saying because I go to a basketball court and bounce the ball around the court that I am a NBA player or because I swing a tennis racquet that I am a professional tennis player. John Lennon was a songwriter, Paul Mccartney, was a songwriter. ¬†I think she gets more help then what is put out there to the public and it's kept hush hush because she fits the mold of the "Girl Next Door" with the good girl look and blonde hair and blue eyes. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not like she is someone I dislike or hate - she's simply to young for me to have any strong feelings for her but I'm getting sick of her getting more credit then she deserves because she looks the part but in the end look what she puts out - just regular pop music, no different then anyone else did. I grew up during the 80s when Pop music became the mainstream style of music so I've heard it now for almost four decades and there is nothing special about her. There just aren't any truly big stars today. If this was the 80s she would take a back seat to Michael Jackson, Madonna, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston and a multitude of Hard Rock bands like Def Leppard, Guns and Roses, Bon Jovi, etc....she's just the biggest of what we have today because she looks the part but think about it - is her music anything different then what any other female puts out? No...it's just Pop music. That's all.¬†	UCv8O2eXwiMetfyHBPrpotUw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv8O2eXwiMetfyHBPrpotUw	1	UgiJwxgC4ybNiHgCoAEC	John Vu

I believe that she did write her own songs from her first album all on her own with at least a little help from one songwriter up until her last two albums with her hit singles on Red that were pop songs on a still country album and her recent 1989 completely pop album where she uses those same songwriters for the entire album to help her. She plays the banjo, ukulele, the piano, and electric & acoustic guitars and she has played all those instruments on stage. I think she is just a very educated girl who has a practice at writing songs and really enjoys it. I think she has a knowledge of these instruments but in a minimal way because her melodies in the past have always been very simple and she uses a little bit production to up-tempo it a bit.

She use to play a little bit of the guitar but by no means was she a musician. How can you write a song when you are no expert on an instrument? She may write some of they lyrics but I bet she has help with that though. She and like most of these "artists" today, don't play instruments. Some of these male bands play instruments and I believe that they write some of their own songs but most are just Recording Artists, not Song Writers.

Like i said though, she is blonde hair and has blue eyes (not that i don't like that), but I'm not blind to things either. She has the girl next door look and the look and act that some parents may want their daughter to model themselves after - she knows this and plays it up, which is understandable to do for her career. However, it may be White America that is buying her albums (i don't mean that in a racist way), and that is the only explanation i can think of as to why her albums sell so well. Look at all the songs that come out, her songs are just regular female pop songs and for young girls too so their not even intended for a mass audience so i believe it's her look and that a lot of young white females are buying her albums, not because she has a diverse fan base. I come from the generation where pop songs became popular, the 80s, and my generation has seen it for thirty years now so we know pop songs, she doesn't do anything different then anyone else and her songs are a little to commercialized too. I just don't think that there is anything special about her and she doesn't do anything that no one else has done either.¬†	UCv8O2eXwiMetfyHBPrpotUw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv8O2eXwiMetfyHBPrpotUw	1	UgiJwxgC4ybNiHgCoAEC	John Vu

If we keep paying attention, listening, watching, going to concerts, buying music, they continue to succeed in the industry. It&#39;s no wonder she&#39;s loved so much. I have her first album, and I remember when I bought it. It was 2006 and I sang Tim McGraw, Should&#39;ve said no, Mary&#39;s Song, Picture to burn, all of them really so loud in my room. I was a freshman in High School I think. Watching her grow up along side with me, amazing. I&#39;m 23 and she&#39;s 25. The amount of success a young woman can have is amazing and gives me hope.

People make fun of Taylor because she&#39;s been a target to audiences for a long time and they like to continue this &quot;joke&quot; of how she writes about everything. Other than her i don&#39;t see any other women being scrutinized for &quot;over sharing&quot;. We have singers like Adele who sing/write about break ups and love and no one tells her anything. So no, I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s sexism. I think it&#39;s just how people treat HER (Taylor) for some reason. I wish she hadn&#39;t mentioned the sexism part because she&#39;s trying to make it seem like all women get treated like that for writing songs when in reality most don&#39;t.

UgiNAixNz6puNHgCoAEC	0	6	2015-02-08 04:35:07	jestifier94	I wouldn&#39;t call it sexist, because Taylor Swift writes songs about specific men who we know about because she famously dates famous people, and I get the feeling she likes it whenever we know exactly who she&#39;s talking about, so it&#39;s a unique case here. There are many women who write songs about how much they have been betrayed by or don&#39;t like men but they keep it ambiguous or they don&#39;t date famous people, so they wouldn&#39;t need to be called out for it. Example:<br /><br />Taylor Swift dates Harry Styles and then writes a break up song... OF COURSE people will be taking about it.<br /><br />(Any male singer/any female singer) dates someone in private/someone who is NOT a public figure and breaks up with them and then writes a song about it... we wouldn&#39;t know who it was in the first place, so no big deal, it&#39;s just another break up song.<br /><br />Sexist? No. &#39;That joke is so old&#39;? That&#39;s a bold statement, plus it&#39;s not a joke, it&#39;s a concept.<br /><br />If Taylor Swift keeps dating famous people and then writing songs against them right after a break up and they get played on mainstream radio, then you can keep expecting people to be going crazy about it, especially the famous person&#39;s fans.<br /><br />But aside from that, I must say that this woman is very admirable.

She always looks SO polished, she always looks perfect not a singel hair out of place.. Her lyrics are about boys and love and I just find it really hard to relate to someone like that? I guess I just don&#39;t understand how so many young girls relate to her. <br />No hate, I think she seems totally nice and fine, just a little cold and unrelatable to me, like plastic.

When you watch her older interviews, she's much more open and carefree. Like from the debut album up through and including Speak Now era, you'll notice a different demeanor in her interviews. Most of us become more composed as we get older but without the incredible expectations and scrutiny she has do deal with. She says she worries about everything. OTOH, you have to admit that the success remains. Maybe there's a connection between the two? Deep down, she's the same person though and is incredibly kind to her fans.

Everyone, Black, White, Male, Female, Jew, Christian, Native American, Asian, should have a say in the world. Even as a guy I believe no matter what your color, religion, ethnicity, culture, no matter where you are, here, or across the gulf of space, you have a basic right to speak in what you believe in.

And her fans are called Swifties!&quot;, and then she goes on to proceed, &quot;If you haven&#39;t guessed her name now, you are clearly living under a very large rock.&quot; Notice the present tense she uses.

But now people think she&#39;s &quot;over sharing.&quot; With male artist, I do agree it doesn&#39;t matter. The biggest rock band, The Beatles mentioned many names of different girls in a lot of songs and nobody seems to care but say they are good songs. Maroon 5 had a whole album named after a girl named Jane. Also, Michael Jackson with Billie Jean... So she has a point in that department and it&#39;s hard for any of us to deny it<br />.

I kind of like Red better, it had All To Well, Begin Again, Everything has Changed, The Last Time, etc. <br />Blank Space is catchy but the song is fake. It isn&#39;t real, it&#39;s a joke she wrote (that&#39;s what taylor said not me). <br />Clean is about the only song that is like her older ones. <br />Welcome to New York is terrible, I don&#39;t want to hear a song about new York unless I live there. I hate it! <br />Anyways, I am not really saying that all her songs from 1989 are bad, I really like blank space and some other ones, it&#39;s just it lacks something that her previous albums had.

As someone who was a fan of hers when she was sixteen and got tired of her cat-and-mouse, who&#39;s-my-next-boyfriend games when she was twenty, I really don&#39;t buy what she said about men and women writing music and being received differently in the media.<br />Successful male artists write music about their famous partners and leave speculation entirely to the press without whining about it or targeting their songs straight to the subject of them. Taylor, on the other hand, systematically dates for song-writing material, denies her relationships and then blatantly references her boyfriends in songs, even <b>names</b> the songs that are about those boys. It&#39;s good to empower women, but do it without demeaning men. We&#39;re equal.	UCMjHTHz35WzVPlpxSSD-COQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjHTHz35WzVPlpxSSD-COQ	0

If she shoots a video with black persons she is racist. She name the persons she is singing about she only hints at it. I do think it is sexism coupled with her polished character. When your flawless people is more critical of what you do. She doesn't only write about ex She doesn't only write about her relationship in a bad light She doesn't name the persons she sing about Same with the male artists. But many find a reason to Hate her because she has a like a perfect personality.

Taylor always played the victim card, called out on people, and honestly her songs are really depressing. Not all of them but yes most of them. The one's getting famous. I don't think putting someone else down is empowering at all. And why all of her experiences are bad? I mean do you have to cry for all of them? You can not "love" everyone. And love is a very different thing from a fling. I love Tom Hiddleston, he's a great actor. Can you imagine him dating Taylor only for fame? Like seriously? She accused him for that. Ok maybe he did that, but every other bf did? Taylor is definitely not a feminist. And please don't talk about donations or charity, because even horrible celebrities do that. And I think it's good. Everyone should. But Taylor's personality is very altered and made up. Not all of it, but some of it. You can see narcissism.

She is writing her feelings down in a song, in fact, to GET OVER THEM. Some people are emotional creatures and whether they put their art and emotion into acting, writing, dancing, art, singing, songwriting, etc. It is a release for them. It sounds like you are one of those people who listen to the singles and not the albums..... Therefore you have nothing to judge.

It just proves she doesnt get over things, it shows how inmature she is, and I don't have a problem with her, this is just a fact. Sam Smith singing about a guy he was in love has nothing to do with Taylor. Most of the love songs are about past loves, IDK where why she said girls cant sing about their emotions cause its practically what all singer do ALWAYS.

If you constantly talk about yourself as a victim, that's just whiny. I love Taylor Swift for her honesty and her connection to (mostly) the female, but she's not a good lyricist from a literary or poetic point of view. There are better lyrics from a more higher form of poetric lyricist that she cannot beat. Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars are definitely much better than her from that point of view. Men and women also have different ways of expressing feelings.	UCM9sTpAQwnZ_znU3-g1br4Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM9sTpAQwnZ_znU3-g1br4Q	1	UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC	heidos7

Bruno Mars mostly writes romantic, "you are beautiful" kind of songs; and Ed Sheeran, although very personal, never overshares. Even with "Don't" we aren't sure who he's singing about, because his RL with Ellie has been a rumor. Taylor is made fun of because she is very vocal about the people she dates, like she will literally write a song about John Mayer with his name in the title. When those guys you mentioned and many FEMALE songwriters learn from relationships and put that life philosophy into songs, Taylor just complains or brags about specific people. She's like that friend who never shut ups about her boyfriends.	UC7f8o1Uai1rLTkFjw1fM7BA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7f8o1Uai1rLTkFjw1fM7BA	1	UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC	heidos7

It's the exact fucking opposite of what you describe.¬† You're just making shit up, and so is Swift. Where did Nick Jonas get "praised" for expressing jealousy? The reason the media disparages Taylor Swift is because 1) she's really famous and 2) she dates other really famous people. This combination provides great ammunition for click bait.

Because it's been implanted in their heads than men aren't supposed to show emotion or let out their feelings, so when they actually do they are praised for it. A man writing a love song or a break-up song is praised for being a 'real man' for talking about his feelings. Take Jealous by Nick Jonas for example (I love him and the song btw). If it had been written by a woman, specifically Taylor, we all know she would've gotten criticism and labeled as the 'crazy obsessive girlfriend' who thinks she owns her boyfriend and no one else can even look at him. And if you really listen to the lyrics, they're kinda creepy in a way. But instead, because it's written by a guy it's 'sweet' and 'romantic'.

People focus on her because she's extra famous and has a history of dating other really famous people. She's pulling the "sexism" shit out of her ass. It's funny, because what she describes is literally the exact opposite of gender exceptions for men and women. In general, it's far more acceptable for women to express their emotions than it is for men. Men are expected not to express certain emotions (e.g. sorrow, fear), and boys are shown much less compassion growing up than girls (according to studies). There is absolutely no bias towards women in this regard - this is just some clueless celebrity spouting about shit she knows nothing about so she can put on as a "feminist."

It's like "well ok but you are a girl you have to keep in the role of a sexual object, not something empowering like a writer, a singer or any useful job". It is so embarrasing, that is never done to men, no interviewer goes to a male singer and says "wow such young, so handsome, such hot". It's just ridiculous and degrading, makes me sick. Reminds me that time a woman astronaut was in an interview. Questions for men were science related, the only question for her was is she was going to wear makeup in space.

And Im not too young, I know about all that. I dont like hollywood too much, and Taylor is one of the few artists of it that i like. You dont know if everything she does is being controlled, you dont know if it was a coincidence or not. It might or might not be, you do not know that! Why if she has famous friends they are not really friends? Maybe they are. And shes not friends with everyone. Shes being going out with Lorde and HAIM a band I dont even know honestly. I understand what you say about the "relationship game" and that is kind of true but it doesnt mean she didnt feel all those things. She might have thrown herself into the world, met guys fell in love (falling in love and true love are two different things) and realized that guy wasnt for her. Ive just watched an interview about one of her new songs where she says that in her previous albums she sang about "you did this and i felt like this" "who is right and who is not" and she said that as you grow up (thats what shes doing, growing up) you realize its not always that someone did something wrong or it was the other persons fault. Last year was a year where a lot of people started speaking about feminism and sexism. Emma Watson did and you know she has an effect in people. Taylor Swift started talking to the woman that writes Girls (i think) and shes who introduced her to all this sexism feminism stuff. Maybe it was a coincidence maybe it was not. You can think it wasnt thats up to you, but like i said before 1000 times... you are no one to judge her, you really dont know her (neither do i but im not judging her) and you havent been through the things she has. Oh and that argument "she chose that lifestyle" she chose making music, she chose doing what she loved. It is not her fault that she suddently got this famous. Obviously she does things now to get other people attention but any artist does. 	UCR8_Zl4w04J0E_UniWotsxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR8_Zl4w04J0E_UniWotsxA	1	UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC	heidos7

Taylor doesn't dress slutty or act vulgar (and I respect her for that) to attract attention but¬†the ''relationship game'' that she plays is what keeps her in the media's sight...her image is 100% controlled and alters in ways that would make her more likeable to the public...it's not a coincidence that when people started calling her basically a ''slut'' after her numerous relationships, she stopped dating and conveniently surrounded herself with a bunch of ''friends''( most of them famous) and started professing things about independancy or sexism towards women...that is damage control in it's greatest form! As for her dealing with hate or criticism, this is the life SHE chose,nobody forced her...this is the price of fame and that's the life of famous people...she has like 200m $ ¬†in the bank, I hardly feel sorry for her and neither should you...

UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-QDLT70Jru0XZ_Sj		12	2015-01-25 00:24:08	Lulu Brito	Again. How can YOU know all those feelings she felt werent real? Lets just say they werent love, but do you have to truly love someone to be a realtionship with them? NO. Love is something that develops slowly. She dated people and she felt things. And she put all those feelings into songs.¬† You say shes been writing about her exes for 7 years. But what you dont know is that she started singing about other peoples relationships, what her point of view about them was, she made up realtionships to write songs, and thats quite normal you know. For example, one of her first songs was Love Story, which has NOTHING to do with her private life and so a lot of her other songs. She has songs about her mom, friends and about going though bullying. Shes got lots of nice love songs were shes not dissing anyone. I think theres even one about blaming her a bit. I dont think youre in any position to judge her cause you dont know exactly what her songs are about. I think it is sexist. Shes not the only artist to be picked on because of that. The difference is she's the one that is the most.¬† Im sorry if there are any spelling mistakes, im not english.¬† And just to clear something up... Im not crazy about her, I really like her music and I have been following her since I was a child but I have never called myself a swiftie. I just think people are not understanding her at all. Who are all of you to judge anyone? Its not nice being judge all the time, you know? even more if you are a celebrity, because then everyone knows what you're doing and nowadays everyone can say something about it.¬† If you received tons of messages in your twitter account telling you you're fake, ugly, fat, stupid, etc you wouldnt be so happy about it. Imagine how she felt about it when she was SIXTEEN. Imagine how hard it is for someone of my age (im sixteen) to go through a normal life having people (that are not as many as taylor does) criticizing you about everything you wear, you do, about your personality and your body. It is not easy to deal with those things. There are people that commit SUICIDE because of this. And I dont think every one of those people deal with all that Taylor has to deal with and had when she was MY AGE.¬† Ive seen a lot of comments of people saying she's not matture. I dont know is she is or she is not. But what I can say is that how could she be matture if, like i said before, shes been dealing with hate since she was just a teen. If I cant deal with all the pressure and I dont have paparazzis sofocating me everywhere I go, how could she???¬† How can you or anyone criticize her if you/they are NOT IN HER SHOES. You havent been through all the stuff she has.¬†	UCR8_Zl4w04J0E_UniWotsxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR8_Zl4w04J0E_UniWotsxA	1	UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC	heidos7

M.	+Lucia Brito¬†I never said that dating is a bad thing or that she shouldn't live her life the way she wants but she can't say people are sexists just because she can't stand the criticism... plus, the fact that her new album is not full of ''boyfriend'' songs doesn't erase the past 7 years that she built an entire career on her private life and her constant personal drama.... and no, two month old publicised flings are NOT real love and ,by no means, are relationships important enough for her to drag for 2 years every time, especially when they involve people who are also famous and even her colleagues... that is simply the PR game that she chooses to play! After RED people started to get annoyed by it so she changed direction, toned it down and now she gives these well-rehearsed speeches in interviews about how the media and the public mistreat her.... nobody would care about her personal life if she hadn't given it to them on the plate all these years... all artists write from personal experience but they write about real emotions,real relationships ¬†and deep feelings...Taylor's mistake was that she didn't choose wisely, she called out every single guy that she dated, making her music a well constructed pattern and I think that's what pisses most people off not the fact that she is a woman who dates a lot of men...

She has had lots of boyfriends yes, but why is that a bad thing? Life is about having new experiences every day. In my poin of view I find her as a person that 10 months ago was really co dependent. Do you have to pick on her because of that? Now she is really fine by herself and I admire that. She doesnt write only about her boyfriends you know. If you took a look at her new album there are exactly FOUR songs where she is "dissing" her exes. FOUR out of 13. The other songs talk about a relationship of a friend of hers (its quite a nice song), about her life, New York, how she got over all this dating stuff, people criticizing her about EVERYTHING and then there are just nice love songs that may or may not be about their exes but they are LOVE SONGS.¬†	UCR8_Zl4w04J0E_UniWotsxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR8_Zl4w04J0E_UniWotsxA	1	UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC	heidos7

Also listen to Ours, Love Story, You Belong With Me, I'm Only Me When I'm With You, Enchanted, Fearless, Begin Again and more. And the songs on 1989 that are about her own personal relationships are simply describing the relationship, her feelings and how it affected her as she is looking back at this love.¬†	UCCLSLoHTaJ9BM6bQcDezwqA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLSLoHTaJ9BM6bQcDezwqA	1	UgjG1emqvTETHHgCoAEC	heidos7

Bruno Mars, for example, often sings about his ex's and current gf's in a good light. When I was your man, Just the way you are, it will rain, etc. Name one TS song that is anything like those songs...

Ugieu1w5QnkOTXgCoAEC	0	1	2014-12-18 02:41:21	jboy ox	Has it ever occurred to Taylor Swift that the people that say &quot;she only writes about relationships, love, ex-boyfriends, etc.&quot; criticize her not because they are sexist, but because they just simply dislike her music?<br /><br />Of course, that doesn&#39;t excuse those critics from such ignorance. And of course I don&#39;t doubt that some of them are sexist indeed.¬† Like she said, there are many artists, male and female, that write about the same subjects. Many of them also receive similar criticism, but it seems like Taylor gets them even more.<br /><br />But I think one of the major differences is that Taylor Swift receives such a large amount of publicity (and I speculate that she&#39;s more publicized than her music industry colleagues) for ever thing she does (whether it&#39;s dating someone or whatever it is). And if you&#39;re constantly on TV, radio, ads, websites, just media in general, there&#39;s going to be a significant backlash of critics.<br /><br />With that being said I do understand her frustration.

Or &quot;Watch out, she&#39;ll write a song about you.&quot; That joke is so old and it&#39;s coming from a place of such sexism.&quot;<br /><br />Don&#39;t, Taylor. Just don&#39;t. I don&#39;t have a problem with your music, in fact I&#39;ve grown to like it, but the joke exists because you have consciously built your career on it. The public isn&#39;t picking which songs you are going to make into a single. It&#39;s not sexism and it&#39;s not a criticism about &quot;oversharing&quot;, it&#39;s a criticism telling you to broaden the subject matters of your song (singles) and the criticism is valid.

A real "bro" guys look up to and girls want to be with them. If a woman writes an angry song, then she is the angry, bitter woman you need to watch out for. Case in point: Joan Jett and Alanis Morrisette. If a woman conforms to the idea of a guy's dream world and strips and wears next to nothing to promote her album, even if the state of mind is nothing close to normal, she is accepted as being normal because she is selling her body on top of music. Case in point: Britney Spears.¬† Why can't musicians just be recognised for their music and for who they are? Why should she see the need to broaden the subject matters of her songs when she grew up sheltered in a privileged background, and relationships (with people, not just romantic love) are the centre of her songs because that is what she knows? It would be pretentious for her to write songs about things she does not understand and doesn't relate to. It would also be weird if she started making songs about her high life and how she is living it up in NYC in her fancy penthouse with the champagne and dough rolling. It's solely her choice what she wants to write about. Like the video said, she's the only artist to have a platinum album in 2014. Clearly her fans is pretty mass market, and they obviously relate to her. Why fix something that isn't broken? Just because you or someone else doesn't relate to her subject matter doesn't mean she needs to change it. Whatever she is doing, it works.¬†	UCNnmtw4tZ7YM_796L1DbD6w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNnmtw4tZ7YM_796L1DbD6w	1	UggzTsvbMBwHcngCoAEC	namelessfire

I love Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, One Direction, Sam Smith etc.but they are all doing the exact same thing Taylor is doing but they don't get called out for it. Take Ed's song "Don't" for example. Now, I love the song and he had every right to write it, but why is no one talking about that while y'all CONSTANTLY talk about Taylor? Sam Smith's entire album is about some guy he was in love with who didn't love him back, but all people talk about is what an amazing singer he is (which they should). So do NOT tell me sexism has nothing to do with it. And FYI, Taylor has many songs that are not about a relationship/breakup but they're not as well known outside of the fanbase. There are also many of her songs where she blames herself for whatever happened in the relationship and apologizes. In the chorus of IKYWT she sings 'Shame on ME'. In Dear John she sings 'I should have known.' Back To December is her saying sorry, the whole song. And the songs on 1989 that are about her own personal relationships are simply describing the relationship, her feelings and how it affected her as she is looking back at this love. Taylor isn't "using" her relationships, she just writes about her personal experiences in life, and a lot is about love. The media acts like she's dated 20 guys in 5 years, but she's dated literally 6 guys in 7 years, and also she writes multiple songs about one guy. Almost the entire RED album is about Jake Gyllenhaal. Honestly I don't fucking care how many guys she has dated or how many songs she writes about them, just as long as she keeps on writing these hits and incredibly beautiful songs! She does NOT bully her exes, she just tells it like it is. And she has even said they have every right to write a song about her or respond to it somehow (which John Mayer did with his song Paper Doll).

I think you hit the nail on the head when you said, "Of course Taylor Swift is more popular, especially right now, because she done more things than Adele." Right now it's safe to say that Taylor Swift is one of - if not the most popular musician at the moment. But I'll tell ya, Adele was inescapable back in 2011. It's easy to lose sight of that since Adele's heyday was almost four years ago and we are currently living in Taylor's right now. But all of that was a side argument that spun out of control for absolutely no good reason anyway. Words get twisted. People don't read. Again - even though we disagree, I like your style and I respect your opinion. Cheers, mate.

Same with "Stay With Me", SNL even did a skit about the downer, whiny quality of that song. But even ignoring all of that, to say most (let alone all) of Taylor Swift's negative criticism comes mostly (let alone entirely) from a place of sexism is a hasty simplification. There are too many other factors and considerations at play to condemn this amorphous, indeterminate mass of tough critics as sexist haters and simply call it a day.

I would be pretty tired of the media judging my songs SOLELY on her love life. Like c'mon she's a young woman who's made TONS of money and created massive success for herself. Maybe hold her to some high standard and not on how many guys she's dated? Who cares tbh. And it IS coming from a place of sexism, never have I heard people judging John Legends "all of me" for being over emotional, or "stay with me" or any other love song written by dudes. Yea most of her music is about love, but there are PLENTY of things to write about when it comes to that.

This is 100% true and here's why: in 2011 Adele's 21 sold 5,824,000 in the US, and in 2012 it sold 4,410,000 in the US. Because of this, 21 was the top-selling album in the US of both 2011 and 2012, two years in a row (to put in in perspective, the last time an album was at the top for 2 years in a row was Michael Jackson's Thriller in 1983 and 1984). On November 2012, Adele's 21 was certified diamond for selling 10 million copies in just the US. This October 2014, 21 has now sold in total of 11 million copies in the US. "The last album to hit 11 million faster than 21 was nearly 12 years ago, when Creed's Human Clay hit 11 million in its 165th week of release (week ending Nov. 24, 2002)" This is according to Billboard. Now let's compare: Taylor Swifts Red was released in October 2012 and sold only a little over 4 million copies in two years in the US (despite having a 1+ million sales mark in its week debut). Adele's 21 sold 10 million in LESS than two years in the US. All of the information is just about the US though, let's not forget about the rest of the world. As of today, 21 has now reached the 30 million mark worldwide. For comparison, if you add up Taylor Swifts five studio albums (Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989), in total they have sold 28,964,336 worldwide. Adele has sold more albums than Taylor's five albums COMBINED with just one album. And let's not forget that Adele's debut, 19, has sold 7 million worldwide. To be fair, Taylor's 1989 is still selling, so Taylor's album sales are increasing at the moment. Now let's go over what you, +LeKaiser , have said so far... "Did you actually just say adele has sold more then taylor this year" - No, +namelessfire specifically stated within the last FIVE years "The only year adele has beat taylor in the past 3 years was in 2012, and thats because taylor didn't have an album then, and yet adele still wasn't even 1st." - What? Taylor's album, Red, was released in 2012. Taylor most definetely had an album that year. And even then, like I already mentioned, Adele's 21 was the top-selling album in 2012 not just in the US, but worldwide (21 wold 8.3 million in 2012 worldwide while Red sold about 4 million worldwide if I recall correctly). Now, with all this said, of course Taylor is more popular than Adele, especially right now, because she tours, sells tickets, sells albums, etc. But +namelessfire is NOT arguing about who is popluar. I just wanted to clarify some things about Adele's 21 that you may not know	UCWXjR4Ul22Elv0ucOf1VOHA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXjR4Ul22Elv0ucOf1VOHA	1	UggzTsvbMBwHcngCoAEC	namelessfire

I don't know what school you went to that thought you that or you just don't know what criticism is? Seeing though the song that made her famous was 'Love story' and it had nothing to do with breaking up. ¬†Not even half of her songs are about breaking up.... you just fall into every sterotype you hear	UC07-7r09HFd1HWMxO_OZW1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC07-7r09HFd1HWMxO_OZW1w	1	UggzTsvbMBwHcngCoAEC	namelessfire

And no matter what you had just said about "popularity is mesaured in different ways by different people" Taylor has beaten adele and most other artist in every way that can measure popularity, Fans, Album sales, Ticket sales, Followers, Subs. Everything. So Lekaiser is actually correct. And what he said was obviously not constructive criticism so it is completely not needed, there is a difference between hate and criticism. You have no experience at all with music obviously by the way you are talking. so please comment more with your uneducated thoughts so i can laugh more. In he's first comment "she is the only one criticized for it because she is the only one who has built her image on it. " That is completely incorrect. If you listen to music from the year 2000+ almost every song is based upon love or breaking up because it effects peoples life. Bruno mars for example. And you single her out for no reason at all. No where near all of her songs are about breaking up if you would actually listen so that whole argument was invalid.

Your first comment in this thread was this: "You try to tell her to change what she's singing about yet she is the most successful music artist of this generation. So everything you say is 100% invalid. So don't bother being such an ignorant person. " According to this, you are saying that being popular and THE MOST successful artist of this generation should exempt that artist from criticism. Therefore, +namelessfire refuted your argument by saying that 1) popularity is mesaured in different ways by different people (no universal consensus) and 2) other artists (including Adele) are among the most successful artist of this generation and not Taylor (Also, what +namelessfire said about Adele is true, but I'll get to that later). +namelessfire also said in that exact comment that, even if Taylor is the most popular, that should not exempt her from valid criticism.

Popularity isn't defined on record sales these days purely because of illegal downloading. Its based on everything tolled up and if you toll up how many tickets taylor sells, albums, views, followers then taylor is purely more popular.

And "Mean" is a bad example because it is not just a song about a bully, it can be very very easily (and has been) interpreted as a song about a bitter ex. 1D and boy bands in general have been relentlessly criticized about the vague, pandering nature of their love songs. Bieber isn't criticized about his love songs, because frankly there is lot of other issues to complain about when it comes to him. The entire rap industry has been under criticism because of its overused subject matter. In fact when a rapper comes out songs about different subjects ("Same Love" "Swimming Pools", etc.) they are praised as a breath of fresh air and rightfully so. All I'm saying is Taylor's claims of sexism might not hit the nail on the head as well as one might initially think. And frankly, it's a little bit too convenient. Dismissing her criticism as sexism not only exonerates her of her past image, but it makes her a feminist icon; which regardless of politics or personal philosophies, you must admit is a trendy and lucrative niche at the moment.

Many of the singles have been about love, romance, and breakups, and many of the ones that are about friends/family sound to the casual listener like songs about love and romance. The critique is justified and saying that it comes from sexism is decisive and largely, though maybe not wholly, unjustified. And guys sharing there feelings isn't always received as brave, it's often received as whiney and not very masculine; which can be, but isn't necessarily, sexist.

I think Taylor's very public previous relationships have a lot to do with this. I know she's single now, by choice, but before that most of her known boyfriends were celebrities themselves, and that lead to the media constantly covering them. And because of that overexposure in the media, I think many of the public got annoyed, and that manifests through criticisms against her. Of course that still does not make it right to criticize Taylor simply because she's a woman, but it's something to keep in mind. Also, I think Mean was not as commercially successful as her other songs because it was just sent to country radio and not pop/mainstream radio (or at least I think). But of course, Mean did reach 11 on the Hot 100, so it was commercial, just not as commercial.

There are different reasons why WANEGBT was more successful than Mean commercially. I think it's wrong to assume that it's completely the public's fault. "Have you ever heard a One Direction song that wasn't about love? How about Bieber? They appeal to the same demographic as Taylor. What about rappers? They all rap about the same things (sex, drugs, money, bitches, etc.), why does no one call them out?" But they ARE criticized. And they are not just criticized for repeatedly singing/rapping about the same subject matters, they are criticized for a lot of other things. I can guarantee you that there is at least one top comment in each One Direction video that is a criticism. It may seem that Taylor receives more harsh criticism for just being a woman (and maybe you are right), but if your commercial image was largely based on love/men/etc. for a very long time, there will be people who think it becomes too repetitive. I'm not saying its necessarily right, especially if it comes from a sexist place, but it happens. My point is that, yes, some of the criticism against Taylor's love songs are sexist, but some of them are not, and it's important to distinguish the two.

Taylor has plenty of songs that aren't about love. But when she releases a single that isn't about love (ie. Mean) it isn't as successful as something that is (ie. We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together) because people like to play the "which ex is this one about" game; but that's beside the point. Have you ever heard a One Direction song that wasn't about love? How about Bieber? They appeal to the same demographic as Taylor. What about rappers? They all rap about the same things (sex, drugs, money, bitches, etc.), why does no one call them out? I think Taylor hit it right on the nail. It's about sexism.

I think it's fair to say that her singles, the music that is commercial and on the radio, are mostly about men, relationships, heartbreak, etc. And for some people, it can be too repetitive if an artist's commercial singles share the same themes. Criticism that says an artist should broaden their horizons artistically is not unheard of. Artists and entertainers of all types, singers, painters, filmmakers, etc., can have such criticism, and it does not have to be bad. Of course, there are some critics who complain out of sexism, but certainly not all of them. And I don't necessarily agree that Taylor has to write about other themes (I'm perfectly fine with her singing about men and love), but the criticism is valid. You don't have to agree, just understand. However, you just can't claim anyone that who disagrees with you is a sexist, that is an accusation with no merit.

And honestly, there are less love songs on the radio than you think.

Also, songwriter association gave her the songwriter of the year awards like 5 years in a row.<br />Everyone who has worked with her praised her a lot. Ryan Tedler said he has never met anyone who can write songs so quickly like her and called her a prodigy. Imogen Heap said she had prejudged her, but after working with Taylor, she had to change her mind. Because Taylor can write great songs and knows what could become a hit.

I just want to point out to everyone you have not spoken one word of truth as you call it from your very first post all the way through to your last one. As I said twice now you would not know the truth if came up to you and shot you in the head at point blank range. If you ever actually speak the truth I would likely die of shock, but we both know you are incapable of speaking the truth. All you have is opinion and again if you look up the word truth you will not see opinion as part of the definition or listed as a synonym.

You get upset and let your overly emotional reaction tell your little brain things and you think they are true somehow. I don't need to fool anyone in the first place because I don't care what you think. As I said I know who I am and what my sexual orientation is. What you believe is of no consequence. Call me gay if you want because that just means I am happy because that is what the word gay means. People who have sex with those of the same sex are homosexuals.

Ughx3hnKVH61FHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-St4u70FdGFbbt_1		2	2015-01-09 06:11:46	NJ Ringlord	+Luciano Vasquez Well since I have never purchased a single one of her albums or songs you again prove you are a complete idiot by calling me a Swiftie when I am not. I just like fucking with losers like you who decide they hate some celebrity they know actually nothing about for reasons they can not actually prove and call it truth. Your claim of knowing if she has been on twitter or tumblr proves to me you are a secret Swiftie as I said before because to know if she has been on or not you have to be following her. Now how stupid is it for someone to follow a person on social media they claim to hate? As to Taylor and her dating life in spite of all the rumors she has had exactly 6 boyfriends in her life and if the reports are to be believed she gave her virginity to Jake G. who was #4 on the list of 6 so at best she has slept with 3 guys assuming she slept with the Kennedy kid and Styles. Do you honestly think it would not have been all over the news with the way the paparazzi follow her 24/7 if any of those 3 had paid her to sleep with them? What failures would that make those 3 look like if they had to pay for sex. You are the ultimate on idiots because you can not think logically and a 1st grader could poke holes in any argument you make with facts that are easily available to everyone. You just refuse to see them in your hatred which has no basis in fact. That is the ultimate definition of a loser is to hate someone for no actual reason and the truth is that Luciano Vasquez is a true loser for hating Taylor Swift for no actual reason.

It's fool's like u that buy all her songs off ITunes and 4or5 albums at a time just because u like her and think she's so nice that's why she sells so many albums. Her song writing is so basic that's why it appeals to 10 to 16 year old if your older then that it say's a lot about your mind set. I'll leave u with the truth wants again about her teeth which stick out more then her small breast. The reason she always looks so happy and is smiling all the time is because her teeth protrude out so much her lips can't cover them.

Ughx3hnKVH61FHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-St4u709m3UNySec		1	2015-01-06 23:33:14	NJ Ringlord	+Luciano Vasquez OK so you don't like her or her music. Well that is not truth fool that is just your opinion. Your opinion has no more value than that of anyone else. Big deal she has small boobs and she does not have an ass that sticks out a mile. Never heard anyone complain about her teeth before. Seems like you are stretching a bit on that one. Anyway again those things are all your opinion or more specifically your personal preference in how a woman should look. None of it is something every person looks at or cares about so again you are not spouting any truths, just opinion and personal preferences. Talent is also based on opinion. If people think she has talent then they buy and listen to her music. Obviously since she has sold close to 40 million albums world wide she has talent or nobody would buy or listen to her music. Your opinion that her talent is minimal does not make it true. As to her riding a wave of what is hot right now¬† I need to point out to you that Taylor is what is hot right now. Her album has been at #1 on the billboard chart 6 of the 8 weeks it has been out only being pushed out of that spot twice by new albums in their first week and 1 of those was One Direction. She was back at #1 the next week and 1D has already dropped to #6 on the chart. Niki Minaj released her new album and sold about 240,000 units in the first week and she debuted at #2. Taylor's album sold over 320,000 copies that same week, the 8th week after it was released and stayed at #1. This may be Taylor's first album where she is labeled as 100% Pop, but RED was mostly Pop and her two albums before that had more of a Pop feel to them than Country so she has always been in the Pop category since so many of her songs get crossover play on Pop radio stations as well as Country. See even on that point you are not speaking any truths because Taylor has been popular for her entire career and will continue to be based on her writing ability and her personality more so than her singing ability which is still very good. You may not like her, but you may as well get used to her because she is here to stay for many years to come.

Its great having no free health care and low taxes right? with high class schools and the rest of the world doesnt look down on you and your government? Oh wait. i was thinking about every other country but yours.	UC07-7r09HFd1HWMxO_OZW1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC07-7r09HFd1HWMxO_OZW1w	1	UgjBHYMSHuEk_XgCoAEC	Luciano Vasquez

Every song on that album is different. Each song is unique in its sound, style, and lyrics. She does not always sing about "men". She is relating her music to her personal life experiences. I don't know what artist who doesn't write/sing about love at some point. It is a human experience everyone can relate to. It's one thing to have an opinion, but you better be correct when voicing it and you ARE NOT.¬†	UCQtwMilJB7kF1hNjqYWNk4Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQtwMilJB7kF1hNjqYWNk4Q	1	UgjBHYMSHuEk_XgCoAEC	Luciano Vasquez

She just saw the negative media attention on her portraying her ex-boyfriends as jerks, so of course, to keep herself number one, she'd do anything. That is why she changed the theme in her songs just at the time the negative attention came to play...or else, she doesn't really care about her songs being sexist as long as they brought her attention on media so that she'll get more famous. Also, her relationship with Styles was just a publicity stunt. That woman really knows how to write fake relationship songs. I guess Bart Baker was right: She is a pscyhopath. Looks genuine and normal, but is actually far from that, who makes you feel as if you're her S.O. That is a typical sign of a pscyhopath.

There are also many of her songs where she blames herself for whatever happened in the relationship and apologizes. In the chorus of IKYWT she sings 'Shame on ME'. In Dear John she sings 'I should have known.' Back To December is her saying sorry, the whole song. And the songs on 1989 that are about her own personal relationships are simply describing the relationship, her feelings and how it affected her as she is looking back at this love. Taylor isn't "using" her relationships, she just writes about her personal experiences in life, and a lot is about love. The media acts like she's dated 20 guys in 5 years, but she's dated literally 6 guys in 7 years, and also she writes multiple songs about one guy. Almost the entire RED album is about Jake Gyllenhaal. Honestly I don't fucking care how many guys she has dated or how many songs she writes about them, just as long as she keeps on writing these hits and incredibly beautiful songs! She does NOT bully her exes, she just tells it like it is. And she has even said they have every right to write a song about her or respond to it somehow (which John Mayer did with his song Paper Doll).

How did you come to that conclusion? Why don't you bother thinking about the men she went out with, instead just jumped at the chance to judge her for "playing the victim card" without knowing anything about her relationships? Do you know personally how her relationships played out? I don't see you or anyone else calling Ed Sheeran a whining bitch for writing about his ex Ellie Goulding. We all know she must be a lovely person, but maybe they had a relationship where she did end up acting like a jerk to him. He wrote about it. No one said a thing. In fact, most media outlets and people went, "oooh look at ed dissing ellie aahahahaha that bitch ohhh burn", etc. Maybe think about it. Don't bother replying if you don't have something useful to say.	UC44FbcWHSyVWsg-a9vTT61A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC44FbcWHSyVWsg-a9vTT61A	1	UghHlHDZq9_xv3gCoAEC	PixelGirl2006

There are so many more nice lyrics that she's written, this is just a few. 1. And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are, hope it's nice where you are. 2. So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night 3. Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt 4. I'll never forget you as long as I live, I wish you were right here right now, it's all good 5. We had a beautiful magic love affair 6. The battle's in your hands now, but I would lay my armor down if you'd say you'd rather love than fight I think it's great that she uses her real relationships in her songs. I don't want to hear someone just singing about partying and sex, there's no meaning to that.

You need to listen to her albums. In her new album 1989 she NEVER blamed a guy there, didn't portray anyone as a jerk, and didn't play as a victim. ¬†She matured. Also almost every successful singer/songwriter out there writes about their personal experiences/relationships as a tool for their success.
